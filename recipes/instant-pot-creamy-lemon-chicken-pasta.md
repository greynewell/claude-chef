## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound dry penne pasta
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 2 medium lemons, juiced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- ¼ cup grated Romano cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), add butter, and select Saute function. When butter melts, add chicken and onion and saute until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute more. Push Cancel to end Saute function.
2. Add dry pasta, chicken stock, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder; stir with a wooden or plastic spoon, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Stir in heavy cream, Romano and Parmesan cheeses. Let the pasta sit in the pot until the sauce is thickened, about 3 minutes.
