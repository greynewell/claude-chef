## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 pounds lamb meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pinch saffron
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 medium onions, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 5  carrots, peeled, cut into fourths, then sliced lengthwise into thin strips
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 1  lemon, zested
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can homemade chicken broth or low-sodium canned broth
- 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon water  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place lamb and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large bowl and toss to coat; set aside.
2. Mix together paprika, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder, coriander, cumin, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, cloves, and saffron in a large resealable bag. Add lamb to the bag and toss around to coat well. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.
3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add 1/3 of the lamb and brown well, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat to cook remaining two batches of lamb.
4. Add onions and carrots to the pot and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and ginger; continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Return lamb to the pot and stir in lemon zest, chicken broth, tomato paste, and honey. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
5. If the consistency of tagine is too thin, you may thicken it with cornstarch and water slurry during the last 5 minutes.
