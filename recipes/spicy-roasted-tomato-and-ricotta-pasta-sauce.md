## Ingredients

- 2 ½ pounds Roma tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise
- 5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
- 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes  (Optional)
- 19 ounces ground hot Italian sausage
- ½  sweet onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss tomatoes, 4 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Place tomatoes cut-side up in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until soft and juicy, about 2 hours. Remove from the oven. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Sprinkle remaining 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, Italian seasoning, rosemary, basil, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, and red pepper flakes evenly over the tomatoes. Drizzle tops of tomatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
5. Return baking sheet to the oven and bake for an additional 20 minutes.
6. Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Cook sausage and onion until sausage is no longer pink and onion softens, about 7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
7. Transfer roasted tomatoes and any juices to a food processor. Process to desired consistency. Add ricotta and Parmesan cheeses and pulse to combine. Pour tomato sauce into a bowl; mix in sausage-onion mixture.
