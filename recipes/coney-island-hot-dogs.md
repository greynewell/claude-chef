## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- 2 cups water, or more to taste
- ½ cup diced onion
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 tablespoons chili powder, or more to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon celery salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 8  all-beef hot dogs
- 8  hot dog buns
- ¼ cup prepared yellow mustard, or to taste
- ¼ cup diced onion, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, water, 1/2 cup diced onion, ketchup, butter, garlic, chili powder, salt, black pepper, cumin, celery salt, and cayenne pepper together in a pot. Mix with a potato masher or spatula over medium-high heat until mixture has a finely ground consistency and begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.
2. Bring beef mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and reduces, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook hot dogs in boiling water until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange hot dog buns on a baking sheet.
5. Cook buns in the preheated oven until soft and warm, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Place 1 bun on a plate. Place a hot dog in the bun and top with meat sauce. Drizzle yellow mustard and diced onion over the meat sauce. Repeat with remaining hot dogs.
