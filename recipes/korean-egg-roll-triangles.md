## Ingredients

- ½ (8 ounce) package dry thin Asian rice noodles (rice vermicelli)
- ½ medium head cabbage, cored and shredded
- 1 (12 ounce) package firm tofu
- 2 small zucchini, shredded
- 4 each green onions, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 2  large eggs eggs, slightly beaten
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 (12 ounce) package round wonton wrappers
- ½ cup vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil, drop in the rice noodles, and boil until the noodles are soft but not mushy, 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Rinse with cold water, and drain in a colander set in the sink.
3. Chop the noodles up into small pieces, and set aside.
4. Wrap the shredded cabbage in a kitchen towel or a length of cheesecloth, and squeeze the excess moisture out.
5. Place the cabbage, tofu, zucchini, green onions, garlic, black pepper, sesame oil, eggs, salt, and chopped rice noodles in a large bowl, and mix with your hands until evenly mixed and the tofu is broken up into very small chunks.
6. Place a round wonton wrapper onto a work surface, and spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons of filling into the center of the wrapper.
7. Dip your finger in water and moisten the edge of the wrapper about halfway around, then fold the wrapper over, enclosing the filling, and pinch the edges together to make a half-moon shape.
8. Lay the completed rolls on a cookie sheet while you finish filling and folding the rest.
9. Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy skillet, and working in batches, fry the rolls until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
