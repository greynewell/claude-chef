## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ pounds beef skirt steak, cut into strips
- kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup thinly sliced shallots
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon Thai red curry paste, or to taste
- ½ cup low sodium chicken broth
- 1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce
- 1 ½ cups sliced zucchini
- 1 large lime, zested and fruit cut into quarters
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Sprinkle beef strips lightly with salt and black pepper, and sear the meat in the hot oil until well browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes, working in batches.
3. Do not crowd beef.
4. Transfer beef to a plate.
5. Reduce heat to medium, and cook the shallots until they start to become tender, about 2 minutes; stir in ginger and cook 1 additional minute.
6. Stir in the curry paste, and fry 1 more minute.
7. Mix in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil, scraping up and dissolving any brown flavor bits from the skillet.
8. Stir in the coconut milk and fish sauce.
9. Increase heat to medium-high, and return beef and any juices to the skillet.
10. Stir to coat with sauce, and simmer until tender, 10 to 12 minutes; stir in the zucchini, cover the skillet, and simmer until zucchini are tender, about 8 minutes.
11. Mix in the lime zest; sprinkle with cilantro.
