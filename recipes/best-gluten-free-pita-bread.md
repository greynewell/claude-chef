## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups gluten-free oat flour (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
- ½ cup potato starch
- ⅓ cup cornstarch
- ⅓ cup tapioca flour
- 2 tablespoons xanthan gum
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup warm milk
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Combine oat flour, potato starch, cornstarch, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer; whisk until well mixed, about 1 minute.
2. Whisk milk, egg, olive oil, and vinegar together in a separate bowl until well combined, about 1 minute. Stir milk mixture in gradually to the flour mixture on low speed; mix until a soft dough comes together, about 5 minutes.
3. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Divide dough into 6 equal pieces; roll each piece on a floured surface to a 6-inch circle. Place on the prepared baking sheets; cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat a pizza stone in the oven.
5. Spray pita breads with water and place them straight on the hot pizza stone.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes.
