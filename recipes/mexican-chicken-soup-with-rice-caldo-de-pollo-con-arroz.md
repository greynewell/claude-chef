## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 5  tomatoes
- ½  onion, roughly chopped
- 2  chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2  carrots, peeled and diced

## Instructions

1. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.

Peel and place in a blender; add onion, chipotle peppers, garlic, and black pepper. Blend until smooth. Strain mixture, discarding solids, for the sauce.
3. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add carrots and celery; saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in blended tomato sauce. Add chicken broth and bouillon. Cook and stir until carrot and celery are soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Add peas and chicken breast; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Serve soup over a spoonful of rice; top with avocado slices and Monterey Jack cheese.
