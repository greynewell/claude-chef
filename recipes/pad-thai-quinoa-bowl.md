## Ingredients

- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cups quinoa, rinsed and drained
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil, divided
- 1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips
- ¾ cup shredded cabbage
- ½ cup edamame
- ¼ cup diced broccoli stems
- 2  carrots, cut into matchsticks
- 2  green onions, chopped
- 3  eggs
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ¼ cup natural peanut butter
- ¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons chili garlic sauce
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ cup salted peanuts, chopped
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken; stir until cooked through; about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from wok. Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil. Add cabbage, edamame, broccoli, carrot, and green onions and saute until vegetables soften slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Whisk eggs with sesame oil in a small bowl. Push vegetables to the sides of the wok to make a well in the center; pour eggs in and stir to scramble, about 3 minutes.
4. Combine peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, ginger, garlic, and sesame oil together in a small bowl. Pour Thai peanut sauce over vegetable and egg mixture in the wok.
5. Return chicken to the wok and add quinoa; mix well to combine. Stir in chopped peanuts and cilantro and serve.
