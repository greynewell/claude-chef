## Ingredients

- 2 pounds tomatillos, husked
- 2  fresh jalapeno peppers
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 dash cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 dash black pepper
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or salt

## Instructions

1. Place tomatillos, jalapenos, and garlic in a large pot. Pour in just enough water to cover the tomatillos; they will float, so press them down with your hand as you measure the water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the color of the tomatillos lightens to a yellow color, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool for about 10 minutes.
2. Strain the tomatillos, reserving the water. Place into the bowl of a blender; add the cloves, cumin, pepper, and chicken bouillon. Puree until smooth, use the reserved water as needed to adjust the consistency.
