## Ingredients

- 8  eggs
- 1 tablespoon water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided
- 6 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 (8 ounce) package Smithfield® Cubed Ham

## Instructions

1. Whisk together eggs, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs, stirring frequently, until scrambled to desired consistency. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
3. Spread 1 teaspoon butter over 1 tortilla and place butter-side down in the same skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle 1/3 cup cheese over entire tortilla. Add 1/2 cup scrambled egg and 1/3 cup ham to one half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Fold cheese side over egg-ham filling, then flip quesadilla. Cook until golden and toasted, about 2 more minutes. Cut into 2 or 3 pieces. Repeat this step to make 5 more quesadillas.
