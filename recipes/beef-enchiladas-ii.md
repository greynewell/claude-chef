## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 (1.5 ounce) package dry enchilada sauce mix
- 10 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium skillet over medium high heat, cook the ground beef and onion until beef is evenly browned and onion is tender.
