## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 6 ounces chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed
- 1  yellow onion, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- ½ cup diced poblano pepper
- ½ cup seeded and diced jalapeno pepper
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 4 cups cooked white rice, or more to taste
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ½ cup chopped green onion
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 2 cups oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Stir pork shoulder, livers, onion, celery, poblano pepper, jalapeño pepper, garlic, salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper, chili powder, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a large pot. Cover the pot with a lid and refrigerate until flavors combine, 2 hours to overnight.
2. Pour enough water into the pork mixture to cover by 2 inches; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from heat. Pour mixture through a strainer, reserving strained liquid and meat separately.
3. Transfer drained meat mixture to a cutting board and finely chop.
4. Stir chopped meat, rice, parsley, and green onion together in a bowl. Gradually add reserved cooking liquid, one ladleful at a time, to meat mixture, stirring until completely incorporated between each addition, until mixture has a paste-like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours to overnight.
5. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Roll chilled meat mixture into 1-inch balls.
7. Make a breading station: Whisk flour, 1 pinch cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Pour breadcrumbs into another shallow bowl. Beat eggs in another shallow bowl.
8. Gently press a ball into flour mixture to coat; shake off the excess flour. Dip ball into beaten egg; press ball into bread crumbs. Place breaded ball onto a plate and repeat breading process with remaining balls.
9. Working in batches, cook boudin balls in preheated oil, turning once, until crispy on the outside and hot on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes.
