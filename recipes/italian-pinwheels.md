## Ingredients

- 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
- 7 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
- 6 slices mortadella
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Lightly dust a rolling pin.
2. Unroll puff pastry and roll out to a rectangle.
3. Cut into 2 pieces lengthwise.
4. Sprinkle one of the puff pastry pieces with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and cover with 3 slices of mortadella.
5. Roll up lengthwise into a tight roll.
6. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
7. Cover rolls with parchment paper and freeze for 30 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
9. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
10. Slice puff pastry roll in 1/4-inch-thick slices and lay on the prepared baking sheets, leaving space in between the slices since they will puff up when baking.
