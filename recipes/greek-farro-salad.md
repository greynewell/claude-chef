## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups farro
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 cup seeded, diced tomato
- 1 cup seeded, diced cucumber
- 1 cup chopped red bell pepper
- ¾ cup thinly sliced red onion

## Instructions

1. Rinse farro with water; drain. Place farro in a pot; pour in chicken broth to cover farro by at least one inch, adding water if needed. Stir in 1 teaspoon olive oil and sea salt.
2. Bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring frequently, until tender, about 35 minutes for whole grain farro or about 20 minutes for pearled farro.
3. Drain farro, rinse with cold water, and set aside to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
4. Whisk 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, Greek seasoning, and garlic together in a large bowl. Stir in tomato, cucumber, red pepper, red onion, and feta cheese. Stir farro into tomato mixture until completely coated with dressing; season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate salad for about 2 hours before serving.
