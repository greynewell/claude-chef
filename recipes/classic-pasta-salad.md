## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package tricolor rotini pasta
- 1 ½ cups Italian-style salad dressing
- ½ cup diced pepperoni
- ½ cup diced salami
- ½ cup diced Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup diced Monterey Jack cheese
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- ⅓ cup sliced black olives
- 12  cherry tomatoes, halved
- ½ medium cucumber, diced
- ⅓ medium red onion, diced

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Strain pasta and run it under cold water to stop the cooking process; you don't want it to be mushy. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.

3. Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.
