- 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1  celery stalk, chopped
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
- 1 (15.5 ounce) can no-salt added dark kidney beans, undrained
- 1 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 4 tablespoons sliced jarred jalapenos
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 ¼ cups cornmeal
- ¾ cup whole wheat flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 1  egg
- 1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 2  green onions, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12x17-inch sheet pan.
2. Crumble ground turkey and place onto one half of the sheet pan. Place onion, bell pepper, garlic, and celery on the other half of the sheet pan. Drizzle both with oil, and season with salt and pepper.
3. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring once, until meat is cooked through and vegetables are soft, about 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, place diced tomatoes, kidney beans, chicken broth, tomato paste, corn, jalapenos, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, oregano, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir until well combined. Carefully pour mixture over the turkey and vegetables, and gently stir to combine.
5. Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add milk, oil, honey, and egg, whisking until combined. Place about 8 dollops of the batter over the top of the chili. Sprinkle each "dumpling" with Cheddar cheese.
6. Carefully return sheet pan to the hot oven, and bake until chili is bubbling and cornbread is browned on top, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sliced green onions just before serving.
