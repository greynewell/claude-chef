## Ingredients

- ½ cup fine Italian bread crumbs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup olive oil
- 16 large sea scallops

## Instructions

1. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
2. Pour olive oil into a shallow bowl.
3. Rinse scallops under cold water, then dip into the olive oil.
4. Press scallops into bread crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded scallops onto a plate while breading the rest.
5. Place the scallops in the refrigerator to allow the breading to set, 20 to 30 minutes.
6. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
7. Brush the scallops lightly with more olive oil.
8. Grill on the preheated grill until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes.
