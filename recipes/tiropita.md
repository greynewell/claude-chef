## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 1 pound feta cheese
- 3 ounces grated Greek Kefalotiri cheese
- 4  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¾ pound phyllo dough, thawed
- ¾ cup melted butter for brushing

## Instructions

1. Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually pour in milk, stirring constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon. Add salt and nutmeg, stirring occasionally, until white sauce is bubbly and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
2. Mash feta cheese in a large bowl with a fork; stir in beaten eggs, grated kefalotiri, and parsley. Pour in hot white sauce and mix well.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly brush a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter.
4. Line the prepared baking dish with a sheet of phyllo dough and brush it with melted butter; keep remaining phyllo sheets covered with plastic wrap while you work. Repeat with 1/2 of the phyllo sheets, brushing each sheet with butter, and letting them come up the sides of the baking dish. Pour in cheese filling.
5. Lay remaining pastry sheets on top of filling, brushing each with butter. Brush the top of the last sheet with butter, then use a sharp knife to score the top sheets into strips about 3 inches wide from one end of the baking dish to the other.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes, then cut into squares and serve hot.
