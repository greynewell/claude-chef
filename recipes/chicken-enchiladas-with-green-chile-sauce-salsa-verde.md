## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
- 4  garlic cloves, minced
- 1 whole roasted chicken, bones and skin removed, meat shredded
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup salsa verde
- 1 (2.5 ounce) can sliced olives, drained and diced
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ½ (4 ounce) can diced jalapeno peppers  (Optional)
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup sour cream
- ½ cup salsa verde
- 16  corn tortillas
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
3. Combine chicken, onion mixture, cheese blend, cream cheese, salsa verde, olives, cilantro, and jalapenos in a large bowl for the filling. Mix well.
4. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour, then chicken broth. Cook until sauce starts to thicken, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in sour cream and salsa verde; cook until heated through. Spread a spoonful of sauce over the bottoms of two 9x11-inch casserole dishes.
5. Wrap a tortilla in a damp paper towel and microwave for about 30 seconds. Fill with the chicken mixture, roll up, and place seam-side down into a baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas until each dish holds 8 enchiladas.
6. Spoon remaining sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle cheese on top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.
