## Ingredients

- 2 ounces dried rice noodles
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 7 ounces ground beef
- 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 small onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 (16 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak noodles in a bowl of hot water until soft, about 5 minutes. Cut noodles into shorter strands.
2. Heat sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add ground beef, mixed vegetables, onion, and garlic. Cook until beef is almost browned throughout, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in noodles; let stand until juices have been absorbed. Add soy sauce to the filling.
3. Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Lay out 1 egg roll wrapper onto a flat work surface; place a diagonal strip of filling across the wrapper. Fold the top corner over the filling; fold in the two side corners; brush center with cold water and roll spring roll over to seal. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
5. Brush the tops of the spring rolls with vegetable oil. Arrange a batch of spring rolls into the basket of the air fryer; cook until crisped and lightly browned, about 8 minutes. Repeat until all are cooked.
