- 3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 3 tablespoons ketchup
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons sweet chile sauce
- 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

## Instructions

1. Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 15 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly.
2. Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
