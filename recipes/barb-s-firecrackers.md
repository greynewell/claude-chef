## Ingredients

- 2 (16 ounce) cans refried beans
- 2 envelopes taco seasoning mix (such as McCormick® Original)
- 1 (16 ounce) container soft cream cheese
- 2 (7 ounce) containers prepared guacamole
- 8 (10 inch) flour tortillas, or as needed
- 72 paper cupcake liners in different colors
- 2  fresh red chile peppers, seeded and cut into thin strips - or as needed
- 2  green onions, chopped

## Instructions

1. Stir refried beans and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl. Place soft cream cheese in a separate bowl and stir until the cream cheese is workable; thoroughly mix in the prepared guacamole.
2. Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spread with 1/2 cup of bean mixture in a smooth, even layer; top with 1/2 cup of guacamole mix in a layer. Roll up the tortilla into a log and moisten the far edge with a little water to seal. Wrap rolled tortillas tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 1 hour to overnight.
3. To serve, unwrap the rolls and trim off the uneven edges of each roll; cut into 1-inch pieces. Place a piece into each cupcake paper and insert a red pepper strip into the end for a wick. Sprinkle appetizers with chopped green onion.
