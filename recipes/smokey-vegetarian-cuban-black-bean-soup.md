## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried black beans
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano, crushed between your fingers
- 2  bay leaves
- 6 cups vegetable stock
- 1 cup diced smoked tempeh bacon (such as Lightlife® Organic Smoky Tempeh Strips®)
- 2 tablespoons dark rum  (Optional)
- 1  jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped
- 2 cups water
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup sliced hard-boiled eggs  (Optional)
- ½ cup finely chopped red onion

## Instructions

1. Place black beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain beans and rinse with fresh water.
2. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir yellow onion, paprika, and cumin seeds until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add red bell pepper, green bell pepper, garlic, oregano, and bay leaves; cook and stir until onion is translucent and bell peppers are tender, 6 to 8 minutes.
3. Mix vegetable stock, black beans, tempeh, rum, and jalapeno pepper into onion mixture. Increase heat to medium-high, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until beans are tender, about 45 minutes.
4. Pour water into bean mixture; season with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans begin to fall apart and soup thickens, 30 to 40 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove and discard bay leaves from soup.
5. Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with hard-boiled eggs and red onion.
