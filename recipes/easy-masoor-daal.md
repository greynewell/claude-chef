## Ingredients

- 1 cup
- 1 slice ginger, 1 inch piece, peeled
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons dried minced onion
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds

## Instructions

1. Place lentils, salt, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and ginger into a medium saucepan. Pour in enough water to cover lentils by 1 inch; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally and skimming off any foam that forms, until lentils are tender and soupy, 25 to 30 minutes.
2. During the last minute of cooking, combine oil, dried onion, and cumin seeds in a small, microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until onion is browned, 45 seconds to 1 minute; be careful not to burn onion.
3. Stir onion-oil mixture into lentils.
