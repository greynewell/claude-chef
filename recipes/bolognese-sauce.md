## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 large onion, minced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ½ pound ground pork
- ½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 2  carrots, shredded
- 1 stalk celery, chopped
- 1 (28 ounce) can Italian plum tomatoes
- 6 ounces tomato sauce
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound pasta

## Instructions

1. Warm oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion, bacon, and garlic in hot oil until bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
2. Place the same large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
3. Stir bacon mixture, tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, carrots, celery, wine, stock, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into meat mixture. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook in boiling water until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
5. Serve sauce over hot pasta.
