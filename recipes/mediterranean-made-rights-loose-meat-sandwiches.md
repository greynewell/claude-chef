## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound ground lamb
- ½ cup minced onion
- 1 teaspoon minced lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 cup water
- 1 (6 ounce) container plain yogurt
- 3 ounces crumbled feta cheese
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon lemon zest
- salt and pepper to taste
- 6  pita bread rounds

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the lamb, and cook until it begins to crumble. Add the onions, and continue cooking until the lamb has browned and the onions have softened, about 5 minutes more. Drain off any excess fat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir in 1 teaspoon lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Stir 1/4 cup lemon juice into the water, then pour 1/4 cup of this mixture into the lamb. Cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated, then stir in another 1/4 cup, and cook again until mostly evaporated. Continue adding the liquid 1/4 cup at a time until you have used all of it. This should take about 30 minutes in all. The meat should look moist, but not be sitting in liquid.
2. While the meat is cooking, make the feta sauce by placing the yogurt, feta cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest into a blender. Puree until smooth, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.
3. Spoon the lamb mixture onto warmed pita bread. Top with the feta sauce to serve.
