## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons ground ancho chile powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground fennel seed
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 small onion, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 ½ cups cooked brown or green lentils
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons water, or as needed
- 2  canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, seeded and minced
- 1 teaspoon adobo or hot sauce
- 8 (6 inch) vegan corn or flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 1 cup chopped tomatoes
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 cup guacamole

## Instructions

1. Combine ancho chile powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, salt, and fennel in a small bowl.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add spice mixture and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 30 seconds.
3. Reduce heat to medium and add cooked lentils, tomato paste, a few splashes of water, and chipotle peppers. Cook, mashing lightly with a fork and adding water if necessary, until lentils are heated through and hold together, about 5 minutes. Season with additional salt if needed and adobo or hot sauce.
