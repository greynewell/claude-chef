## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 cup quinoa
- salt to taste
- 2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 ½ tablespoons teriyaki sauce
- ¾ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
- 2  carrots, peeled and chopped
- ¼  onion, chopped
- 3  scallions, chopped, divided
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ½ cup frozen peas

## Instructions

1. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let sit for 5 minutes; fluff quinoa with a fork. Refrigerate until cool, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Mix soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until sauce is evenly mixed.
3. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over high heat; saute carrots and onion for 2 minutes. Add 2 scallions, garlic, and ginger; saute until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and quinoa; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.
4. Stir sauce into quinoa mixture; cook and stir until evenly coated, about 2 minutes.
5. Make well in the center of the quinoa mixture. Pour eggs into the well; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add peas and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add remaining scallion.
