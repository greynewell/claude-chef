## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 medium egg
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ cup Greek yogurt
- ½ cup milk
- 2 medium mangoes, peeled and diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform cake pan.
2. Beat sugar, butter, and olive oil together in a large bowl until light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in egg and brandy.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a separate bowl. Mix flour mixture into the wet ingredients alternately with yogurt and milk, stirring just until combined. Gently fold in mango. Spread into the prepared pan; batter will be thick.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely.
