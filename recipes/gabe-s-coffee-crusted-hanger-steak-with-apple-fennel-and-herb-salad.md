## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- ¼ cup finely ground dark roast coffee beans
- ¼ cup ground ancho chile pepper
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons hot smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
- 1 pound hanger steak
- salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 4  shallots, halved
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 tablespoon butter, cut in small pieces
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons honey
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 bulb fennel, halved
- ½  lemon, juiced
- ½  apple, cut into matchstick-size pieces
- 1 tablespoon fresh mint leaves, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley leaves, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, or to taste
- ¼ cup pomegranate seeds
- 2 tablespoons chopped hazelnuts

## Instructions

1. Cook and stir fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and coriander seeds in a skillet over medium-high heat until toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a spice grinder or food processor; add coffee, ancho chile pepper, brown sugar, kosher salt, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Grind until spice rub is a medium-coarse texture.
2. Break steak down into 4-ounce pieces. Lightly score steak 1/2-inch x 1/2-inch and season with salt. Rub steak with spice rub. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high. Pack spice rub onto all sides of the steak and place in the hot cast iron skillet; drizzle about 1 teaspoon olive oil over steak.
3. Cook steak in the cast iron skillet until well browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and scatter shallots, smashed garlic, thyme, and butter around steak. Cook steak until desired doneness is reached, 4 to 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let steak rest for 5 minutes; cut into thin slices.
4. Whisk juice of 1 lemon, lemon zest, olive oil, honey, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl until dressing is evenly mixed.
5. Thinly shave fennel and toss with juice from 1/2 lemon (to preserve color) in a bowl. Add apple, mint, parsley, and cilantro. Drizzle dressing over salad and toss gently; season with salt and pepper. Arrange steak slices on top of salad and scatter roasted shallots, pomegranate seeds, and hazelnuts on top.
