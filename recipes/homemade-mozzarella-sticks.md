## Ingredients

- 2  eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 10  egg roll wrappers
- 10  mozzarella string cheese sticks
- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Beat eggs in a mixing bowl. Whisk in milk, then set aside.
2. Place bread crumbs into a resealable plastic bag; set aside.
3. Separate and lay an egg roll wrapper onto a flat, clean work surface with one of the tips pointed towards you. Moisten the two far edges of the wrapper with water. Place a string cheese stick onto the corner nearest you, then roll it in 1/3 of the way. Fold over the right and left corners, then continue rolling to the end, pressing to seal. Repeat this step with remaining string cheese sticks and egg roll wrappers.
