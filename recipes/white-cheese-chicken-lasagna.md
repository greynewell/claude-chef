## Ingredients

- 9  lasagna noodles
- ½ cup butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups ricotta cheese
- 2 cups cubed, cooked chicken meat
- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Whisk in flour until lightly browned and onion is tender, about 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, milk, and salt; cook, whisking continuously, for 1 minute.
4. Stir in 2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan until well combined. Season with basil, oregano, and black pepper; remove from heat and set aside.
5. Spread 1/3 of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, ricotta, and chicken. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the chicken and layer with 1/3 of the sauce mixture, spinach, remaining 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Arrange remaining noodles over cheese and spread remaining sauce evenly over noodles. Sprinkle with parsley and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes.
