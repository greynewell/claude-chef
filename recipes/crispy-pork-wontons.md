## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) pork tenderloin, cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1  green onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 dash soy sauce
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package square wonton wrappers
- 1  egg white, beaten
- 2 quarts peanut oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, lime juice, crushed red pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a food processor. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Pulse until pork is minced to the consistency of ground beef.
2. Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Brush each wonton with egg white.
3. Pour the peanut oil into a large pot and preheat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).
4. Gently drop wontons into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain.
