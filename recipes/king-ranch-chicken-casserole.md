## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  white onion, diced
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of chicken soup
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®)
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon chipotle chile powder
- 1  cooked chicken, torn into shreds or cut into chunks
- 8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese
- 10  corn tortillas, cut into quarters

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
3. Add both cans of condensed soup, diced tomatoes with chile peppers, chicken broth, sour cream, cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder; mix until sauce is well-combined.
4. Spread a few tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the sauce, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the tortillas.
5. Spread the remaining chicken over the tortillas. Spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over the chicken, then top with another 1/3 of the Cheddar, and the remaining tortillas. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup over top, and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar.
6. Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.
7. Turn on the broiler and broil until the top is golden, 2 to 3 more minutes.
