## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta, cooked and kept warm
- 2 (5 ounce) cans Bumble Bee® Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, undrained
- 1 (6 ounce) package frozen peas
- 8 ounces fresh peas, rinsed
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ½ cup julienne cut sun-dried tomatoes with herbs, drained, oil reserved
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch Crushed red pepper flakes to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place the oil from the sun dried tomatoes in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add in onions and garlic. Cook over medium heat until onions begin to turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the broth to the onions and bring to a simmer.
2. Stir in the peas and the sun dried tomatoes. Cook for another 3 minutes. Peas should remain crisp so be careful not to over cook.
3. Stir in undrained tuna and heat through. Be careful not to break up too many large pieces of the tuna while stirring. Cook about 2-3 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and crushed red pepper if desired.
4. Serve immediately over hot pasta. Garnish with parsley and top with grated Parmesan cheese.
