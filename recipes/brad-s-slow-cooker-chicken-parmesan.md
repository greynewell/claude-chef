## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3  eggs
- 12 ounces Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 6 tablespoons butter, divided, or more to taste
- 2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce, or more to taste
- 12 slices mozzarella cheese
- 1 (3 ounce) package Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons oregano
- 2 tablespoons basil
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Spread flour on a shallow plate. Beat eggs in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken breasts in flour. Dip in egg and roll in bread crumbs to coat.
2. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry breaded chicken breasts, 2 at a time, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and chicken breasts.
3. Layer chicken breasts in a slow cooker, covering each layer with marinara sauce.
4. Cook on low until flavors combine, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
5. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
6. Place chicken breasts side-by-side in a baking dish, spooning additional sauce on top. Place 2 slices mozzarella cheese over each piece of chicken. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese, oregano, basil, and garlic powder on top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
