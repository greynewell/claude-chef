## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 large cucumber
- salt to taste
- 1 (17.6 ounce) container full fat plain Greek yogurt (such as FAGE Total®)

## Instructions

1. Stir together olive oil, vinegar, and garlic in a bowl and let sit while you prepare the cucumber.
