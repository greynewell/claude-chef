## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 4  white fish fillets
- 1  onion, coarsely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and chopped
- 5  cashew halves
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ cup chopped tomato
- ¼ cup vegetable broth
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Mix the mustard, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of canola oil in a shallow bowl. Add the fish fillets, turning to coat. Marinate the fish in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, and cashews in a blender or food processor and pulse until the mixture forms a paste.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the prepared paste; cook and stir for a minute or two. Add the cayenne pepper, turmeric, cumin, coriander, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar. Cook and stir for an additional five minutes. Stir in the chopped tomato and vegetable broth.
5. Arrange the fish fillets in a baking dish, discarding any extra marinade. Top the fish with the sauce, cover the baking dish, and bake in the preheated oven until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 30 minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
