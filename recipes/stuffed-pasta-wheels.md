## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons water, or more as needed
- 1 (7.5 ounce) can wild salmon
- ⅓ cup dry bread crumbs
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 3 cups prepared marinara sauce, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika  (Optional)
- ¼ cup water, or as needed
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon freshly chopped Italian parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Crack egg into the center and add cold water. Stir until it comes together in a shaggy dough. Combine with your hands. Knead on a work surface until it smoothes out and is a relatively firm disc of dough, adding flour as needed. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, place salmon in a bowl and mix with a fork. Add bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese; mix with a fork to combine. Add spinach, eggs, garlic, black pepper, cayenne, and salt; stir together until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Place pasta dough on a floured surface and pat into a rectangle. Roll with a floured rolling pin into a 14x12-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick.
5. Spread filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 3-inch border on one of the long sides. Lightly brush the exposed dough with water and roll up starting from the side closest to you. Finish with the seam on the bottom and use your hands to shape the tube as uniformly as possible.
6. Trim off any excess dough on the ends if necessary. Slice the stuffed tube of dough into 8 equal "wheels" and turn onto their sides. Gently press with floured fingers to flatten slightly.
7. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Cook wheels until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
8. Pour marinara sauce into an 8x10- or 9x12-inch baking dish and stir in cumin and paprika. Add wheels and top with Parmesan cheese.
9. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and chopped parsley.
