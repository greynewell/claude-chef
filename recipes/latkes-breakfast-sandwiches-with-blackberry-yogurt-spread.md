## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons plain Greek yogurt
- 1 tablespoon blackberry jam
- 1 ½ cups shredded hash brown potatoes (such as Simply Potatoes®)
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1  egg, beaten
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup canola oil
- 10 ounces ground breakfast sausage (such as Jimmy Dean® Maple Sausage)
- 2 slices Cheddar cheese
- 2  eggs
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix Greek yogurt and blackberry jam together in a bowl until spread is smooth; refrigerate.
2. Place potatoes in cheesecloth and wring, extracting as much moisture as possible.
3. Combine potatoes, flour, beaten egg, and salt together in a bowl until thoroughly mixed.
4. Divide potato mixture into 4 equal portions and form into 4-inch patties.
5. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Cook potato patties in the hot oil until golden brown, about 6 minutes per side.
7. Remove latkes from oil and place on a cooling rack, reserving oil in the skillet.
8. Form breakfast sausage into two 5-ounce patties.
9. Cook patties in the same skillet until browned on the outside and no longer pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
10. The internal temperature should be 160 degrees F (73 degrees C).
11. Transfer patties to the cooling rack and top each with Cheddar cheese.
12. Heat a non-stick skillet and add 2 tablespoons reserved heated oil.
13. Crack 2 eggs into heated oil and cook for about 5 minutes.
14. Spread blackberry spread onto 2 of the latkes; top with sausage-Cheddar cheese.
15. Add 1 latke to the Cheddar cheese layer of each, creating a sandwich.
16. Top each sandwich with an egg; season with salt and pepper.
