## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  chili moritas, or more to taste
- 1 large white onion, diced
- 5  carrots, peeled and diced

- 2 cloves garlic
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a large heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat; add olive oil. Cook and stir chili moritas in the hot oil until chili moritas are puffed and softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir onion, carrots, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper into chili moritas and cook until onion is translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
