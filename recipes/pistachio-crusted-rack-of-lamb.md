## Ingredients

- 2  racks of lamb, trimmed
- 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ⅔ cup chopped pistachio nuts
- 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Generously season each rack of lamb with herbes de Provence, salt, and black pepper.
