## Ingredients

- 4 cups hot water
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 4 teaspoons MAGGI® Instant Chicken Bouillon
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup uncooked Arborio rice
- 1 cup LIBBY'S® 100% Pure Pumpkin
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or chopped fresh sage leaves
- ½ cup BUITONI® Refrigerated Freshly Shredded Parmesan Cheese
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 pinch Ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine water, wine and bouillon in large measuring cup; set aside.
2. Heat oil in large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in rice; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in pumpkin and thyme.
3. Stir in 1 cup broth mixture. Reduce heat to medium; continue adding broth mixture, 1 cup at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more broth. Rice should be tender but firm to the bite and mixture should be creamy. This should take 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in cheese and butter until melted. Season with pepper.
