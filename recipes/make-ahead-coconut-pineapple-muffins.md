## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup vanilla Greek yogurt
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 1 ½ teaspoons coconut extract
- 1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
- ½ cup sweetened shredded coconut
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons fresh pineapple juice

## Instructions

1. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Set aside.
2. Cream sugar and butter in a second bowl with an electric mixer. Add Greek yogurt, egg, and coconut extract; beat until well combined. Add in flour mixture and mix until just combined. Fold in pineapple, coconut, and pecans. Cover and refrigerate batter for 8 to 12 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line with paper liners.
4. Fill each liner with batter using an ice cream scoop.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a wire rack. Cool completely before glazing.
6. Combine brown sugar and pineapple juice for glaze in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until sugar has melted, 20 to 25 seconds. Dip each muffin into the glaze.
