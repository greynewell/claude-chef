## Ingredients

- 1 pound boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/3-inch pieces across the grain
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 4 cups leftover cooked rice
- ¼ cup thinly sliced green onions
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken thighs, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, brown sugar, and black pepper in a bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 2 hours to overnight.
2. Heat a wok or very large skillet over high heat for 30 seconds. Pour in vegetable oil. Reduce heat to medium; add onion and garlic. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3. Increase heat to high and add marinated chicken to the wok; cook, stirring constantly, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes.
4. Push chicken mixture to one side of the wok; pour eggs into the empty side. Cook until just starting to set, about 2 minutes. Stir eggs slowly until scrambled; mix into chicken mixture. Season with 3 tablespoons soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper; stir for 1 minute.
