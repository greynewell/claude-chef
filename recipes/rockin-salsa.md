## Ingredients

- 1  red onion, chopped
- 1  white onion, chopped
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 6 pounds fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 2  banana peppers, chopped
- 3  green bell peppers, chopped
- 3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
- ½ cup white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 ½ tablespoons salt
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 8  pint canning jars with lids and rings

## Instructions

1. Combine red onion, white onion, yellow onion, tomatoes, banana peppers, green peppers, tomato paste, white vinegar, garlic powder, salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot. Simmer until thick, about 3 hours.
2. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the salsa into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
3. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Refrigerate after opening.
