## Ingredients

- 9 ears fresh sweet corn, husks removed
- 8 strips bacon, diced
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 medium red or yellow bell pepper, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- 1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 6 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 4 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup sour cream, or to taste
- ¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Cut the corn from the cobs. Take the back of a large knife and scrape it against the cobs to extract as much of the "milk" as you can. Set both aside in a bowl.
2. Cook bacon in a saute pan over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
3. Heat oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, and jalapeno; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock and potatoes; bring to a low boil.
4. Lower heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook until potatoes are just about tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add corn kernels and any accumulated "milk," half-and-half, oregano, and cumin. Simmer until corn is tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Ladle into bowls and garnish with sour cream and Cheddar cheese.
