## Ingredients

- ¼ cup orange juice
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce

- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 (1 pound) salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1  lemon, cut into 4 wedges

## Instructions

1. Mix orange juice, honey, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger together in a small bowl.
2. Place salmon in a shallow dish. Pour all but 3 tablespoons of the orange juice mixture on top. Reserve remaining mixture in the bowl. Let salmon marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
