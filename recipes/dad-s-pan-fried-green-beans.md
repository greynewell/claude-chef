## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic

## Instructions

1. Place the green beans in a large saucepan or pot with one inch of water. You may place them in a steamer insert if you have one. Bring to a boil, cover and cook for 5 minutes, they should still be firm and bright green.
2. In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, balsamic vinegar and sugar; set aside.
