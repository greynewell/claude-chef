## Ingredients

- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 3  Thai green chiles
- 6  green beans, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 large unripe papaya, peeled and cut into thin strips
- 1  tomato, halved and seeded
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon palm sugar
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts

## Instructions

1. Combine garlic, chiles, and green beans into a mortar and pound roughly. Add the papaya and pound again, to bruise the ingredients. Stir in fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar and pound again. Ad the tomato and pound to combine. Stir in the chopped peanuts and serve.
2. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can make a version of this in your blender or food processor: coarsely chop the garlic, chile peppers, and green beans. Mix in the papaya, and pulse a few times. Mix in the tomato, fish sauce, lime juice, and sugar. Pulse to combine; salad should still have texture. Transfer to a serving dish and stir in the peanuts.
