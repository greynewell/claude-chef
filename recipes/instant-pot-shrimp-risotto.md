- 3 each green onions
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¾ cup Arborio rice
- 1 pinch pinch dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons dry white wine
- ½ pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ¼ cup frozen peas
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat seafood stock in a microwave-safe container for about 3 minutes on High. Leave in the microwave until ready to use.
2. Slice green onions. Separate green and white parts.
3. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Melt 1 tablespoon butter. Add garlic and white part of the green onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until onion has softened and garlic is fragrant, about 2 1/2 minutes. Add rice and thyme. Saute, stirring occasionally, until rice begins to have a little color, about 3 minutes.
4. Pour in wine and cook, stirring, until wine evaporates, about 30 seconds. Stir in the heated seafood stock, making sure contents of the pot move freely. Turn off Saute function.
5. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
6. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Add shrimp, peas, and reserved green onion tops. Close the lid and allow the shrimp to cook using the Keep Warm function, about 7 minutes. Open lid and check to see if shrimp are done.
7. Add grated Parmesan cheese and remaining 1 tablespoon butter, stirring until butter is melted. Serve with fresh parsley and lemon wedges.
