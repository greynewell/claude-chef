## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon chile paste
- 2 tablespoons orange marmalade
- ½ pound cooked shrimp
- 2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
- 3 cups water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  orange bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 cups sugar snap peas
- 1  sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
- ¼ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, chili paste, and orange marmalade together in a small bowl. Stir shrimp into the marinade; refrigerate for one hour.
2. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok. Cook the orange pepper, red pepper, sugar snap peas, and onion in hot oil until they just begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Toss the marinated shrimp, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil into the vegetables; continue to cook until shrimp is heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
4. Serve over hot jasmine rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds.
