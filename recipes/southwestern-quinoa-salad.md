## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 cups chicken broth
- ½ cup diced green bell pepper
- ½ cup diced red onion
- 1 cup corn
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro
- 1 large tomato, diced
- ½ cup fresh lime juice, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon adobo seasoning
- ½ cup feta cheese
- salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Rinse quinoa thoroughly under cold water; drain.
2. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir quinoa until water evaporates and quinoa is lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until quinoa has absorbed broth, about 10 minutes. Cool quinoa in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes.
3. Mix together green bell pepper, red onion, corn, black beans, cilantro, tomato, lime juice, red wine vinegar, olive oil, adobo seasoning, and feta cheese in a large salad bowl.
4. Lightly stir in quinoa; season with salt, pepper, and additional lime juice to taste. Chill salad at least 30 minutes before serving; serve cold.
