## Ingredients

- 1 pound medium button or mini-bella mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- 1  cooked boneless chicken breast half, finely diced*
- 1 ½ tablespoons Diamond Crystal® Kosher Salt
- ¾ teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whipping cream
- 5 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
- 1 tablespoon finely shredded mozzarella or Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Remove stems from mushrooms, but do not discard them. Using a small melon baller, scoop out insides of each mushroom, leaving at least half the shell to allow more room for filling. Finely chop mushroom stems and centers.
3. Melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Add onion and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Stir in chicken, chopped mushrooms, kosher salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 3 minutes. Blend in flour, cream, and 3 tablespoons parsley; cook and stir until bubbly and thickened. Remove from the heat.
4. Spoon mixture evenly into mushroom caps. Place in a lightly oiled, shallow baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven 10 minutes. Top with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley and garnish with cheese. Bake 5 to 10 minutes longer or until hot and cheese melts. Garnish with remaining parsley.
