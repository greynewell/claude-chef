## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice
- ½ cup water
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 (6 ounce) box chicken-flavored dry bread stuffing mix

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.
