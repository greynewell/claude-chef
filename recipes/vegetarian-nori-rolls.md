## Ingredients

- 2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice
- 2 ¼ cups water
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons honey
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 3 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2 inch strips
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 4 sheets nori seaweed sheets
- ½  cucumber, julienned
- ½  avocado, julienned
- 1 small carrot, julienned

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan cover rice with water and let stand for 30 minutes.
2. In a shallow dish combine soy sauce, honey and garlic. In this mixture marinate tofu for at least 30 minutes.
3. Bring water and rice to a boil and then reduce heat; simmer for about 20 minutes, or until thick and sticky. In a large glass bowl combine cooked rice with rice vinegar.
4. Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo mat. Working with wet hands, spread 1/4 of the rice evenly over the nori; leave about 1/2 inch on the top edge of the nori. Place 2 strips of marinated tofu end to end about 1 inch from the bottom. Place 2 strips of cucumber next to the tofu, then avocado and carrot.
5. Roll nori tightly from the bottom, using the mat to help make a tight roll. Seal by moistening with water the 1/2 inch at the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Slice with a serrated knife into 1 inch thick slices.
