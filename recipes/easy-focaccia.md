## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups bread flour
- 1 ½ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
- 1 ⅓ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Stir together both flours and salt in a large, stoneware bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; sprinkle sugar and yeast into the well. Carefully pour the water into the well. Let stand until the yeast begins to act, about 5 minutes.
2. Pour 2 tablespoons oil into the well. Stir the center of the mixture with a wooden spoon, gradually widening the are you are stirring to incorporate all the flour.
3. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead just until smooth. Keep the dough soft.
4. Pour 1/2 teaspoon oil into a clean bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, turning once to oil the top. Cover and let rise until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.
5. Grease a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil.
6. Punch the dough down and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Gently press dough out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch.
7. Pour the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons oil over the top of the dough. Use the handle end of a wooden spoon to dimple the dough at 1 1/2 inch intervals. Sprinkle with rosemary and Parmesan cheese. Place in a cold oven on the center shelf. Place a flat pan of hot water on the shelf below the bread. Let rise until doubled in size, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. Turn the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the focaccia until browned on top, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the pan, and cool on a wire rack. Serve warm.
