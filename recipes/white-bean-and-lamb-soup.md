## Ingredients

- ½ pound dried great Northern beans, sorted and rinsed
- 1  onion, chopped
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 ¼ pounds ground lamb
- 3  carrots, peeled and diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 1 ½ cups canned roma tomatoes, with liquid
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- fresh ground black pepper
- salt to taste
- 6 cups chicken broth
- ½ pound baby spinach leaves
- 4 ounces feta cheese, crumbled

## Instructions

1. Soak the dried beans in water overnight. After soaking, drain off remaining water, and rinse.
2. In a large stockpot, cook the onion in oil over low heat until just beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Stir in garlic, and cook for 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium, and add lamb; cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in carrots and celery, and cook for 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes, and season with parsley, thyme, oregano, and with freshly ground pepper and salt to taste. Add beans and broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, boil for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, for 1/1/2 hours, or until beans are tender.
3. Rinse spinach, and then place in a saucepan. Place over medium heat, and cook until wilted. This will only take a short time, and you will not need to add more liquid to the pan.
4. Top each serving of soup with wilted spinach and crumbled feta cheese.
