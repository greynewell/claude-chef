## Ingredients

- 1 cup fresh basil leaves
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 ½ tablespoons toasted pine nuts
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 (5 ounce) filet mignon steaks
- 1 ½ cups olive oil

## Instructions

1. Combine basil, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and pine nuts in a food processor and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
3. Rub salt over steaks. Spread some pesto evenly on both steaks and place into an oven-safe glass dish. Pour oil into the dish, ensuring there is enough oil to submerge the steaks.
4. Cook steaks in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Drain steaks and blot off excess oil.
5. Heat a cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear steaks in the hot oil on both sides and the edges for 30 to 45 seconds.
