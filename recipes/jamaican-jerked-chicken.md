## Ingredients

- ½  green onion, minced
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno peppers
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Combine green onion, orange juice, ginger, jalapeno, lime juice, soy sauce, garlic, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves in resealable container. Seal and shake to combine. Add chicken and coat; marinate for 8 hours.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken; reserve marinade.
3. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, turning halfway through, 12 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 170 degrees F (77 degrees C).
4. Meanwhile, bring reserved marinade to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Drizzle over cooked chicken.
