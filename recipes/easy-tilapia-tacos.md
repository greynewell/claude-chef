## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 (4 ounce) skinless tilapia fillets
- garlic powder, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- ½  avocado
- ⅓ cup low-fat sour cream
- garlic powder, or to taste
- salt to taste
- 4  flour tortillas
- ½ cup mango salsa
- 8 leaves iceberg lettuce

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tilapia fillets and sprinkle with garlic powder and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, turn, and continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes. Break fillets apart with a spatula, remove from the heat, and allow to cool. Wipe skillet clean with a paper towel.
2. While fish is cooling, mash avocado in a small bowl for guacamole. Mix in sour cream and season with garlic powder and salt.
3. Place 1 tortilla in the cleaned skillet and cook over low heat until warm, about 1 minute. Remove tortilla and set on a plate with the uncooked side facing up. Cover one half of the tortilla with 2 lettuce leaves and salsa. Spread guacamole on the other half, then add 1/4 of the fish. Fold halves together. Repeat to make the remaining tacos.
