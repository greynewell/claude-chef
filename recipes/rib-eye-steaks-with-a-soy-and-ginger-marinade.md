## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup real maple syrup
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- ½ cup beer
- 4 (10 ounce) beef rib eye steaks

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, mustard powder, sesame oil, and hot pepper sauce in a medium mixing bowl; mix well to blend. Add beer and stir lightly to mix.
2. Prepare steaks by scoring any fatty outside areas on steak with a knife (this prevents the steaks from curling when grilling). Place steaks in a casserole dish and pour marinade over. Using a fork, punch holes in steaks so that the marinade penetrates into the meat. Turn steaks over and repeat punching holes.
3. Cover with clear wrap or foil and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.
4. Prepare and preheat a grill to high heat. Place steaks directly on the grill and sear one side for about 15 seconds. Turn steaks over and cook for about 5 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 5 minutes for medium-rare, depending on thickness. Test for doneness by cutting into the middle of the steak.
