## Ingredients

- 5 slices Wonder® Classic White Bread
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 1  carrot, peeled and chopped
- 1  rib celery, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid
- 2 cups low sodium vegetable juice cocktail or tomato juice
- 2 cups water
- ⅓ cup minced fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh flat-leaf parsley
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 6 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. Cut bread into 3 strips; cut each strip into thirds, making 9 cubes. Place bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes or until very crisp. Set bread aside to cool.
2. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven. Add onion, carrot, celery and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are quite tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir in remaining ingredients, except crisp bread cubes and Parmesan cheese. Heat to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 25 to 30 minutes.
4. To serve, ladle soup into individual serving bowls and top each with crisp bread cubes. Top with shredded Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
