## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¾ pound Roma (plum) tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, or more to taste
- salt and ground pepper to taste
- 1 pound butter, cut into cubes
- 3 tablespoons grated red onion
- 6 cloves garlic, or more to taste, minced
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh basil, divided
- 2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 10  fresh mushrooms, quartered
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Arrange tomato halves onto prepared baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil over the tomatoes; season with salt and pepper.
3. Roast tomatoes in preheated oven until edges are crisp, about 35 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to cool; cut into small chunks.
4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain. Transfer to a large bowl.
5. Melt butter in a skillet over low heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and half the basil in the hot butter until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
6. Stir shrimp, tomato chunks, mushrooms, and garlic powder into the onion mixture. Increase heat to medium-low and cook and stir until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 6 minutes.
7. Pour shrimp mixture over the angel hair pasta; top with Parmesan cheese and lemon juice and toss to coat pasta completely. Garnish with remaining basil.
