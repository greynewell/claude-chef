## Ingredients

- 2 cups cherry tomatoes (such as Sun Gold)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 14 ounces penne pasta
- ½ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Instructions

1. Combine cherry tomatoes, oil, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until garlic is just toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.

3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
