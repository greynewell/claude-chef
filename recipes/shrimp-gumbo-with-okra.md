## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds uncooked medium shrimp
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, divided, or to taste
- 3 quarts water
- 1 medium onion, diced, divided
- 1 large green bell pepper, diced, divided
- ½ cup butter
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste, or more to taste
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green pepper and onion
- 1 pound okra, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- ⅛ teaspoon Cajun-style crab boil seasoning, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Peel shrimp and toss shells with 1/2 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning. Place seasoned shells into a pot with water, 1 tablespoon diced onion, and 1 tablespoon diced bell pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce to a simmer and cover. Let cook for at least 2 hours; the longer it cooks, the more flavor will be in your stock.
2. Meanwhile, devein shrimp by gently running a knife along the back; this will also make your shrimp plump nicely when cooking. Toss shrimp in remaining Cajun seasoning and place in the refrigerator.
3. Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add flour slowly, stirring constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon. When all flour is added, continue stirring frequently until roux turns brown in color and has a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add remaining onion and bell pepper; saute with roux until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in tomato paste.
4. Stir in tomatoes, okra, and shrimp stock slowly. Add crab boil seasoning. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer and let cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Stir in shrimp and continue cooking until shrimp are bright pink but not tough, about 20 minutes.
