## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add Italian sausage, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Pour beef stock into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add water and bouillon cubes.
3. Add tomato sauce, cannellini beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, green beans, diced tomatoes with juice, carrots, tomato paste, soup mix, cabbage, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, pepper, and salt. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 40 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain.
5. After soup has cooked for 40 minutes, add cooked shells. Simmer for another 5 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with shredded Parmesan cheese.
