## Ingredients

- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup fish sauce
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet Garden®)
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, cilantro, sesame oil, ginger, Sriracha, garlic, lime juice, and lemongrass paste together in a bowl.
2. Put chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over chicken, and marinate for 2 hours or overnight for an even better flavor.
3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken thighs from marinade, discarding marinade.
