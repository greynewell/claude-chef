## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package Korean sweet potato noodles (dangmyun)
- 5 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 4 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3  carrots, cut into matchsticks
- 1  onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced
- 6  green onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (16 ounce) bag fresh spinach
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
2. Toss noodles with 2 teaspoons sesame oil in a bowl. Cut into shorter pieces using kitchen shears. Set aside.
3. Combine soy sauce and sugar in a bowl; set aside.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté carrots and onion until soft, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, green onions, and garlic. Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add noodles, soy sauce mixture, and spinach. Cook and stir until noodles are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
5. Remove the skillet from heat. Toss in remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil and sesame seeds.
