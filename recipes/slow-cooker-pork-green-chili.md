## Instructions

1. Rub the inside of a slow cooker with about 1 tablespoon oil and turn on Low.
2. Mix salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, 1 teaspoon cumin, onion powder, chili powder, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Rub spice mixture all over pork. Top pork with cornstarch and pat to coat completely.
3. Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Sear pork in hot oil on all sides until almost black, about 5 minutes. Transfer seared pork to the slow cooker.
4. Reduce heat to medium and pour beef stock into the skillet. Whisk until boiling, scraping up browned bits, about 5 minutes. Boil gently for 3 to 4 minutes more. Strain stock into the slow cooker. Add salsa, Hatch chiles, diced tomatoes, and potatoes.
5. Combine tomatillos, 1/2 the cilantro, jalapeño pepper, Anaheim pepper, serrano pepper, remaining cumin, and liquid smoke in a blender. Blend on high power and add to slow cooker.
6. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours.
7. Remove pork from the slow cooker and shred using two forks. Return meat to slow cooker. Season with additional salt and pepper.
8. Serve chili in bowls with Mexican cheese, sour cream, and remaining cilantro.
