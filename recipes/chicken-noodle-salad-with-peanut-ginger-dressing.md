## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup smooth peanut butter
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon Asian garlic-chili sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger root
- ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 tablespoons low-sodium chicken broth
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) package uncooked linguine pasta
- 3 ½ cups cooked chicken, cut into strips
- 1 cup julienne-sliced carrot
- 6  green onions, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
- 1  celery rib, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. To make the dressing, place the peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili-garlic sauce, brown sugar, ginger, red pepper flakes, and 3 tablespoons of chicken broth together in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Thin the dressing to your taste by adding more chicken broth or water.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the linguine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and place pasta into a large mixing bowl.
