## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup quinoa
- 10 leaves kale, cut into small pieces
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 large garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground sea salt
- 1 cup pecans
- 1 cup currants
- ¾ cup crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Stir quinoa into the boiling water, reduce heat to medium-low, place cover on the saucepan, and cook until water absorbs into the quinoa, about 12 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and let rest covered for 5 minutes. Remove cover and allow quinoa to cool completely.
2. Put kale in a large mixing bowl.
3. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, garlic, pepper, and salt together in a bowl until oil emulsifies into the mixture; drizzle over kale. Add cooled quinoa, pecans, currants, and feta cheese to the dressed kale and toss to incorporate.
