## Ingredients

- 4  English muffins, split
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- 4 large fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 8  black olives, pitted and halved
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 4 slices mozzarella cheese, halved
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Toast muffin halves under broiler until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Mix garlic, butter, and basil together in a small bowl; spread butter mixture evenly onto each toasted muffin half.
2. Combine tomatoes, olives, and tomato paste in a large bowl; set aside. Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and honey in a small bowl.

3. Return muffins to broiler; cook until the cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
