- ⅛ teaspoon almond extract
- 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons dried cherries
- 1 tablespoon semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 5 8-oz ramekins.
2. Combine rolled oats, Greek yogurt, almond milk, maple syrup, eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a blender. Blend on high speed until batter is smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. To one ramekin, add pumpkin puree, cranberries, walnuts, and pumpkin pie spice. To the second ramekin, add sweetened coconut, sliced almonds, and almond extract. To the third ramekin, add cocoa powder, cherries, and chocolate chips. To the fourth ramekin, add blueberries, maple syrup, and lemon zest. To the fifth ramekin, add raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice.
4. Divide batter evenly between the prepared ramekins. Carefully stir each ramekin individually until all additional ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. Place ramekins onto a baking sheet.
5. Bake until tops spring back lightly when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool 10 minutes before serving. Alternately, cool completely, cover, and place into the refrigerator or freezer for later. Re-warm before serving.
