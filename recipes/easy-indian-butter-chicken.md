## Ingredients

- 1 cup butter, divided
- 1  onion, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 3 cups heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

4. While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.
