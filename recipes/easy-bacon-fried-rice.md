## Ingredients

- 6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 cup frozen French-cut green beans, thawed
- ½  onion, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1  egg, beaten
- 3 cups cold cooked rice
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally until just beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Drain all but 1 to 2 teaspoons of bacon grease from the skillet. Add green beans, onion, and garlic. Sauté until bacon is crisp and green beans and onions are softened, about 3 minutes.
2. Push bacon mixture to one side of the skillet; heat sesame oil on the empty side, about 30 seconds. Pour in egg; cook until just set, about 1 minute. Stir into bacon mixture to combine.
3. Mix in rice. Stir in soy sauce until rice is evenly coated. Cook until rice is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
