## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 cup fresh whole-wheat breadcrumbs
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1  egg, beaten
- ¾ cup chopped onion
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  basil leaves, torn, plus additional for sprinkling on top

## Instructions

1. Make the meatballs: Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, beaten egg, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Form into 12 balls. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
2. Make the sauce: Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes, salt, sugar, and bay leaf. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.
3. Stir in tomato paste, pepper, and basil; stir in meatballs. Simmer on low heat until meatballs are cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
4. Discard bay leaf before serving.
