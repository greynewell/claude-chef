## Ingredients

- 10 medium eggs
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- ½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ¼ cup prepared ponzu sauce
- ¼ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- 2 tablespoons chopped scallions
- 1 clove roasted garlic
- ½ teaspoon light brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ teaspoon togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)
- ½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a pot. Cover with about 1 inch water. Remove eggs and stir vinegar into water. Bring to a boil. Gently place eggs back in the pot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes to soft-boil. Cook 3 minutes more for hard-boiled eggs. Prepare an ice bath in the meantime.
2. Remove heat and immediately place eggs in the ice bath. Peel eggs carefully.
3. Combine soy sauce, ponzu sauce, mirin, scallions, garlic, brown sugar, sesame oil, togarashi, and ginger in a container such as a jar. Mix well to ensure sugar dissolves and garlic breaks up.
4. Place eggs in mixture and seal. Marinate for 1 day. Eggs keep for 3 or 4 days after.
