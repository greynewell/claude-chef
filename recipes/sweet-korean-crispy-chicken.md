## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon minced ginger
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 3  chicken breasts, cut into bite-size pieces
- 6 tablespoons honey
- ¼ cup cider vinegar
- 4 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean chile paste)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon minced ginger
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- ½ cup cornstarch
- canola oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger, salt, and 1 pinch pepper in a bowl with the chicken. Allow to sit for 20 to 30 minutes.
2. Combine honey, vinegar, brown sugar, gochujang, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger, and 1 pinch black pepper in a pot over medium heat. Stir well; when bubbling, reduce heat to low and simmer 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
