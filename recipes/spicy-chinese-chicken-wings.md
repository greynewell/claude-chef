## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken wings
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup rice wine
- 3 tablespoons chili garlic sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Rinse and pat dry the chicken wings. Whisk together the sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and garlic in a large bowl, then add the chicken wings and toss to evenly coat.
2. Heat a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken wings, sauce, and water. Cover and cook until the chicken wings are no longer pink at the bone, turning the chicken wings occasionally, about 15 minutes.
