## Ingredients

- 4  zucchini, cut into spirals using a spiral slicer
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- cooking spray
- 4 slices mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place zucchini spirals in a colander and sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt and Italian seasoning over zucchini; toss to coat. Set colander over a bowl to allow water from zucchini to drain.
3. Wrap chicken in plastic wrap and place on a work surface; pound into 1/4- to 1/2-inch thickness. Remove plastic wrap and season chicken with salt and pepper.
4. Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over low heat.
5. Coat a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet.
6. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
7. Place zucchini in the same nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 4 minutes.
8. Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast and top with mozzarella cheese.
9. Broil chicken in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
10. Transfer zucchini to each serving plate and add chicken. Spoon warm marinara over each piece of chicken and top with Parmesan cheese.
