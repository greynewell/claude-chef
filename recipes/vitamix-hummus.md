## Ingredients

- 2 (15 ounce) cans chickpeas
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic
- 1  lemon
- ⅓ cup tahini (sesame seed paste)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 dash ground cumin, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour 1 can of chickpeas with its liquid into a Vitamix® blender. Drain the second can of chickpeas, reserving liquid. Set liquid aside and add chickpeas to the blender.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 6- to 8-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute until just turning golden in color, about 1 minute. Immediately remove from heat and add sauteed garlic with pan oil to the blender.
3. Use a citrus press to squeeze juice from the lemon directly into the blender, avoiding getting seeds into mixture. Add remaining oil, tahini, salt, and cumin.
4. Blend thoroughly on high speed for 1 to 2 minutes. Add in desired amount of reserved chickpea liquid slowly and continue blending until desired consistency is reached, 2 to 3 minutes. To serve, scoop hummus into a flat serving bowl and spread evenly around in a circular fashion.
