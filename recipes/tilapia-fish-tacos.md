## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¼ teaspoon fajita seasoning
- 4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets
- ¾ cup frozen white corn
- ¾ cup canned black beans
- ⅛ teaspoon fajita seasoning
- 2  pineapple rings, cut into chunks
- ½ small red onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
- 12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1  avocado, sliced
- ⅛ head cabbage, chopped
- ¼ cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon fajita seasoning over tilapia fillets and arrange on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake tilapia in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove fish from oven and cut each fillet into 3 pieces.
4. Spray a skillet with cooking spray and add corn, black beans, and 1/8 teaspoon fajita seasoning; cook and stir over medium-high heat until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.

6. Pour 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat; add 4 tortillas and cook until heated through, about 30 seconds per side. Remove tortillas from skillet and repeat cooking the remaining tortillas in the remaining oil.
7. Place a piece of tilapia onto each tortilla and top with corn mixture, pineapple mixture, cilantro, avocado, cabbage, sour cream and a squeeze of lime.
