## Ingredients

- 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1 inch pieces
- ¾ cup olive oil, or more if needed
- 6 cloves garlic, pressed
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound dry fettuccine pasta
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 pound uncooked shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
- 2 tablespoons seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®), or to taste
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, or more if desired

## Instructions

1. Separate asparagus tips from remaining pieces.
2. Heat 3/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until it begins to turn brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in asparagus (not the tips); season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until tender but still bright green, about 10 minutes. Add asparagus tips; cook and stir for 5 minutes.
3. While the asparagus is cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in fettuccine and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well.
4. Return fettuccine to the pot. Drizzle 2 teaspoons olive oil over noodles; toss to coat. Cover to keep warm.
5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer asparagus from the skillet to a plate; leave excess oil in the skillet.
6. Pat shrimp dry with paper towels, then place into the hot skillet. Sprinkle shrimp with seafood seasoning and cook over medium-high heat until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center. Stir in asparagus and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 more minutes.
7. Stir shrimp and asparagus into the cooked fettuccine. Add Parmesan cheese and toss to coat, adding more olive oil if needed to generously coat all ingredients.
