## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 (16 ounce) packages frozen corn
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups shredded Mexican-blend cheese
- 2 (4 ounce) cans diced jalapeno peppers
- 6 slices bacon, or more to taste
- 2 cups shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Combine corn, cream cheese, Mexican-blend cheese, and jalapeno peppers in a bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
