## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup poppy seeds
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1  lemon, zested
- 1 pinch salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2  large eggs
- ½ cup Greek yogurt
- ½ cup whole milk
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- ½ cup unsalted butter
- 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
2. Combine flour, poppy seeds, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt in a small bowl.
3. Combine butter and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in Greek yogurt. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until thoroughly combined. Add the flour mixture gradually, folding together until just combined. Spoon thick batter into the prepared cake pan and spread evenly.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 10 minutes before transferring to a cake platter or plate to cool completely.
5. Meanwhile, make the ermine frosting. Combine milk and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until sugar is dissolved, then add flour. Whisk until no lumps remain and the mixture thickens to the consistency of pudding. Remove from heat; stir in lemon juice. Let cool completely, about 10 minutes.
6. Beat butter and salt with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the milk-flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time, and beat on medium speed until well combined and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes.
7. Spread the frosting over the cooled poppy seed cake.
