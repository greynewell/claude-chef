## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) jar prepared pesto (such as Barilla® Rustic Basil Pesto)
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 3 ounces lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4  chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Mix together pesto, Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, pepper, and salt in a 1-gallon resealable freezer bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
4. Cook chicken on the preheated grill over indirect heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
