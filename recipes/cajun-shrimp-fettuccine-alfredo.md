## Ingredients

- 2 ounces dry fettuccine pasta
- 1 ½ teaspoons all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon salt-free Cajun seasoning
- 5 ounces large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter
- ½ teaspoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon finely grated garlic
- ¼ cup unsalted chicken stock
- ⅛ teaspoon white pepper
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup light whipping cream (18%)
- salt to taste
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water and drain the remaining water.
2. Combine flour and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Pat shrimp dry and add to the bowl, tossing to coat.
3. Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place shrimp into the skillet once the butter bubbles and cook for 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a clean bowl. Add garlic to the same skillet and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour chicken broth into the skillet and scrape up any brown bits.
4. Whisk in remaining flour-Cajun seasoning slowly until well incorporated. Season with white pepper and red pepper flakes. Reduce heat to medium-low and slowly whisk in cream; cook for 2 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese slowly, whisking constantly. Cook until sauce has thickened, 2 minutes more. Return shrimp to the skillet and add pasta; toss to combine.
5. Mix in a little of the cooking water if the sauce is too thick, 1 tablespoon at a time. Taste and season with salt, if necessary. Serve sprinkled with parsley.
