- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ¼ teaspoons salt
- 3 cups high-gluten bread flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast

## Instructions

1. Place water, milk, vanilla extract, brown sugar, white sugar, cardamom, coriander, vegetable oil, and salt into the pan of a bread machine in that order. Pour the flour onto the other ingredients, and sprinkle the flour with yeast. Set the bread machine to the Dough cycle; turn on the machine.
