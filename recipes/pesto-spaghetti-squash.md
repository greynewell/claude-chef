## Ingredients

- 1  spaghetti squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1  onion, sliced
- 1 cup kale, stems removed and leaves chopped
- 4  white mushrooms, sliced
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.

4. Stir in squash, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes; cook for 2 minutes. Remove from stove and place squash mixture in a large bowl.
