## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ cup diced red onion
- ½ cup diced red bell pepper
- ½ cup diced fresh mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ cup chopped fresh spinach
- ½ teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 4  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 4 slices prosciutto
- 12  toothpicks
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¾ cup fine dry bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1  serving avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Add red bell pepper and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in chopped spinach and garlic. Continue stirring until the spinach is slightly wilted. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
2. Stir in feta cheese crumbles, breaking up any large pieces.
3. Pat chicken pieces dry and place on a secure cutting board. Cut a 'pocket' into each breast by inserting a knife in the thickest part of the breast and slicing parallel to the cutting board, leaving about 1 inch at each tip. Be careful not cut all the way through the thinnest edge of the breast.
4. Preheat the air fryer to 370 degrees F (190 degrees C) if preheating is recommended by the manufacturer.
5. Separate prosciutto slices and place on a clean prep surface. Place 2 tablespoons of vegetable-feta mixture on top and roll around the filling, creating an oblong bundle. Tuck 1 prosciutto-wrapped bundle into each sliced chicken breast, and close the opening with toothpicks.
6. Combine Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, parsley, salt, and pepper on a plate. Dip each stuffed chicken breast into beaten egg, then dredge in breadcrumb mixture. Spray with avocado oil spray.
7. Transfer to the air fryer basket and cook until browned, about 15 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
