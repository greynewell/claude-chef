## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package chicken tenders
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup ranch dressing
- ⅓ cup Buffalo wing sauce
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2 cups shredded Colby Jack cheese
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
- 2 cups crushed corn chips (such as Tostitos®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add chicken tenders. Cook until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and cool until easily handled, about 5 minutes. Shred chicken with 2 forks.
3. Beat cream cheese in a blender until smooth. Add ranch dressing, Buffalo wing sauce, and water; blend until smooth. Mix in shredded chicken and Colby Jack cheese.
4. Spread rice in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour Buffalo chicken mixture on top. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese on top. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese is melted and bubbly, about 45 minutes. Sprinkle corn chips on top.
