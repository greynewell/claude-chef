## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package spinach spaghetti pasta
- ½ cup butter, divided
- 5  pollock fillets
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 (7 ounce) can escargot, drained
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese for topping

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook until tender, about 7 minutes. Drain, stir in a tablespoon of butter, and set aside.
2. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until lightly browned. Lay the pollock fillets in the skillet, and cook until golden on each side, about 5 minutes. When the fillets are starting to be done, break them into pieces with a fork or spatula.
3. Add the remaining butter to the skillet, and stir in the escargot. Cook and stir for about 4 minutes. Escargot cooks fast like shrimp, so watch it. Remove from the heat, and season with parsley, oregano and basil. Top with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.
