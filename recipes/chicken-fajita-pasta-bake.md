## Ingredients

- 1 pound ziti pasta
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, sliced
- 1  green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 pound boneless chicken breast, cubed
- 1 (16 ounce) jar salsa
- 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (15 ounce) can corn, drained
- 1 (16 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ziti and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.
2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and green pepper; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
3. Cook chicken in the same skillet until no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes.
4. Combine salsa, cream cheese, and taco seasoning in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until cream cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Combine ziti, chicken, salsa mixture, onion mixture, black beans, and corn in a large bowl. Add 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese and mix until combined. Pour into a baking pan.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar over top. Continue to bake until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes.
