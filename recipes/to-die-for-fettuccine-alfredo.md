## Ingredients

- 24 ounces dry fettuccini pasta
- 1 cup butter
- ¾ pint heavy cream
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 dash garlic salt

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
2. In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.
