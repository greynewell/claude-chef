## Ingredients

- 1 (1 1/2 pound) eggplant
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- ¼ cup chicken stock
- 1 teaspoon chili sauce
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 4 tablespoons water
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 large green onions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger root
- ¼ pound fresh shrimp - peeled, deveined, and diced
- ⅓ pound lean ground beef
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 4 cups hot cooked rice

## Instructions

1. Remove the eggplant stem and cut into 1-inch cubes. In a medium bowl, combine the soy sauce, chicken stock, chili sauce, sugar, ground black pepper and oyster sauce. Stir together well and set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water, and set aside.
2. Coat a large, deep pan with cooking spray over high heat and allow a few minutes for it to get very hot. Saute the garlic, half of the green onions, ginger and dried shrimp, if using (see Cook's Note) for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until they begin to brown. Stir in the ground beef or pork and cook for 3 more minutes, again stirring constantly, until browned.
3. Pour the eggplant into the pan and stir all together. Pour the reserved soy sauce mixture over all, cover the pan, reduce heat to medium low and let simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you're using fresh shrimp, add it during the last few minutes of cooking. Stir in the reserved cornstarch mixture and let heat until thickened. Finally, stir in the rest of the green onions and the sesame oil.
4. Serve over hot rice.
