## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) package prepared pie pastry, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese, drained
- ½ cup confectioners' sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ⅓ cup mini dark chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Roll pie dough out to desired thickness. Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over one side and firmly press into the dough. Place a nonstick mini cupcake pan on top of dough for an outline. Cut out dough cups using a knife or biscuit butter. Press dough pieces into the mini cups; do not grease.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until dough has slightly puffed and is golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
4. Mix ricotta cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Fold in chocolate chips. Place into a plastic bag and refrigerate until ready to serve.
5. When ready to serve, cut a small hole in the corner tip of the plastic bag and pipe into pastry shells.
