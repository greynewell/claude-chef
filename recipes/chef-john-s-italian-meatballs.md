## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup plain bread crumbs
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 pound ground pork
- 2  eggs
- ¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
2. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.
3. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in onion. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.

Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.
5. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
6. Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
