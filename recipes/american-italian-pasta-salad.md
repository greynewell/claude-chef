## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix
- 1 cup frozen petite peas, thawed
- 2 (2 ounce) cans sliced black olives
- 1 cup cubed Genoa salami
- ¾ cup chopped green onions
- ¾ cup chopped celery
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fusilli and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 13 minutes.
2. While the pasta is cooking, whisk together mayonnaise, sour cream, milk and Italian dressing mix in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside.
3. Drain fusilli, then rinse under cold water and drain again. Transfer to a large salad bowl.
4. Add thawed peas, salami, green onions, celery, olives, and parsley. Pour in all but 1/2 cup of the reserved dressing and mix until ingredients are well combined. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.
5. When ready to serve, remove pasta salad from the refrigerator. Stir, then add more dressing if it appears dry.
