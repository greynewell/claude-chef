## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 cups diced chicken breast meat
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 5 (3.5 ounce) links mild Italian sausage
- 5 (15 ounce) cans Italian-style stewed tomatoes
- 4 (16 ounce) cans diced tomatoes
- 1 (16 ounce) can tomato paste
- 3 tablespoons dry crab and shrimp boil seasoning
- 1 pound littleneck clams
- 1 pound mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp (30-40 per pound)
- 1 pound bay scallops
- 2 (16 ounce) packages angel hair pasta

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the chicken and garlic, followed by the sausage links. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is firm enough to slice, about 10 minutes. Slice the sausages into 1/2 inch thick pieces, and return to the pot.
2. Puree the stewed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste in batches using a blender. Stir the tomato mixture into the pot along with the shrimp boil. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes. Stir in the clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops, then simmer 30 minutes longer. Remove from the heat, and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
3. While the jambalaya is cooling, bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil; stir in the angel hair pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Serve the jambalaya over the cooked pasta.
