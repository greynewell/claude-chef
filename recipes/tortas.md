## Ingredients

- 4 (3 ounce) thin-cut beef round steaks
- 4  Mexican-style sandwich rolls (bolillos)
- ¼ cup sour cream, divided
- 1 (15 ounce) can pinto beans - drained, rinsed, and mashed - divided
- 2  avocados - peeled, pitted and sliced
- 2 large tomatoes, sliced
- 2  pickled jalapeno peppers, sliced into quarters lengthwise
- 2 cups shredded romaine lettuce, divided
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 cup crumbled queso fresco (Mexican fresh cheese), divided
- 1  lime, quartered

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and pan-fry the round steaks 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness.
2. Slice the rolls lengthwise. Spread about 1 tablespoon of sour cream onto one side of each roll, and top with about 1/3 cup of mashed pinto beans per sandwich. Place a cooked round steak per sandwich on top of the pinto beans, and then layer each sandwich with one-fourth of the avocado slices, tomato slices, and sliced pickled jalapenos, about 1/2 cup of shredded lettuce, 1/4 cup of cilantro, and 1/4 cup of crumbled queso fresco cheese. Squeeze a lime wedge over each sandwich, close, and serve.
