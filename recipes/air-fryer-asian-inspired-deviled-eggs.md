## Ingredients

- 6 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 ½ teaspoons sriracha sauce
- 1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger root
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- toasted sesame seeds
- 1  green onion, thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Place eggs on an air fryer rack or trivet with enough space between them for air to circulate. Set the air fryer temperature to 260 degrees F (125 degrees C) and set the timer for 15 minutes. Close air fryer.
2. Remove eggs from the air fryer and put them in a bowl of ice water for 10 minutes. Remove eggs from water, peel, and cut in half.
3. Carefully scoop out yolks and place into a mini food processor. Add mayonnaise, sriracha, sesame oil, low-sodium soy sauce, Dijon mustard, ginger root, and rice vinegar. Process until thoroughly combined and mixture has a creamy, mousse-like consistency.
4. Fill a piping bag with the yolk mixture and evenly distribute into egg white halves until they are heaping full; you can also use a spoon to do this. Garnish with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and green onion.
