## Ingredients

- 2 large russet potatoes
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup frozen corn, thawed
- ¼ cup picante sauce
- 1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 1 tablespoon minced red onion
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Prick potatoes a few times with a fork. Rub potatoes with 1 teaspoon oil and set directly on the oven rack. Bake for 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool until easily handled. Keep the oven on.
3. Cut the potatoes lengthwise and scoop out flesh to within 1/4 inch of skin. Brush remaining oil over the skins and sprinkle with salt. Place them on a baking sheet skin-side down and bake for 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine black beans, corn, picante sauce, jalapeno, onion, lime juice, and cumin in a bowl. Stir until evenly combined.
5. Divide filling between the potatoes and top with Cheddar cheese. Bake until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.
