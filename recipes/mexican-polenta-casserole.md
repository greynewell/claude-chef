## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Grease a 3-quart glass casserole.
3. Break up 1 tube polenta in the casserole and press evenly so it covers the bottom of the dish.

5. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until glistening.
6. Add onion and bell pepper and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
7. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds.
8. Lower heat to medium and stir in turkey, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper.
9. Cook and stir until turkey is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
10. Add black beans, drained tomatoes, and salsa and bring to a boil.
11. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes.
12. While turkey mixture is simmering, bake polenta crust in the preheated oven until firm, 7 to 10 minutes.
13. Remove polenta crust from the oven and sprinkle with 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese.
14. Top with turkey mixture and lay sliced polenta on top.
15. Return to the oven and bake for 25 minutes.
