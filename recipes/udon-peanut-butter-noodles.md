## Ingredients

- 1 (9 ounce) package dried udon noodles
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 1 ½ tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1 ½ tablespoons honey
- 2 teaspoons chili oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 whole rotisserie chicken, skinned and boned, meat pulled into large chunks
- 1  red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped peanuts
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the udon in a few noodles at a time and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain; return to the pot.
2. While the udon noodles are cooking, whisk the chicken broth, ginger, soy sauce, peanut butter, honey, chile oil, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, whisking until the peanut butter has melted. Pour the sauce over the noodles. Add the chicken and red bell pepper; toss until the noodles are evenly coated in the sauce. Sprinkle with green onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro to serve.
