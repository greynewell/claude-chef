## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package dry pasta
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- 12 ounces brown gravy
- ½ cup half-and-half
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat a large frying pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pan until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato sauce, gravy, half-and-half, Parmesan cheese, garlic, oregano, and basil. Simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in ziti, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
4. Stir ziti into meat sauce, then spread into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle top with mozzarella cheese.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 20 to 30 minutes.
