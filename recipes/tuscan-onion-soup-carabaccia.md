## Ingredients

- 4 pounds red onions
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 3 leaves sage
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup finely ground almonds  (Optional)
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or to taste
- 5 cups beef broth, or more as needed
- 3 thick slices Italian bread, halved
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste, divided
- 3 leaves sage, or to taste, sliced into thin strips
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste, divided

## Instructions

1. Trim ends off onions; halve and peel. Cut onions into thin slices lengthwise along the grain.
2. Heat olive oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and kosher salt. Cook and stir until starting to turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft and sweet, about 1 hour.
3. Add sage leaves, pepper, cinnamon, and almonds to the onions. Cook and stir until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer mixture to a soup pot. Pour in red wine vinegar and broth. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until flavors blend, about 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a small baking sheet with aluminum foil.
5. Place Italian bread on the baking sheet. Drizzle some olive oil over the bread; sprinkle sliced sage and some Parmesan cheese on top.
6. Toast in the preheated oven until browned, about 15 minutes.
7. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top each with a piece of toast. Drizzle remaining olive oil over the toast and sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese on top. Dunk toast into the soup and let soak for a few minutes before serving.
