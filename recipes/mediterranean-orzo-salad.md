## Ingredients

- ½ (16 ounce) package uncooked orzo pasta
- ½ pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- ½ cup diced red onion
- 1 cup diced cucumber
- 1 cup pitted Mediterranean olives, cut in half

- 1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh garlic
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ cup red wine vinegar
- ½  lemon, juiced
