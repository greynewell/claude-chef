## Ingredients

- 1 pound Italian sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®), casings removed
- 6 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1  onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, pressed
- 2 (32 ounce) cartons chicken broth
- ½ cup water
- 1 cube chicken bouillon (such as Knorr®)
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 5 cups chopped cauliflower florets
- 3 cups stemmed and chopped kale
- ½ cup half-and-half
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook the Italian sausage in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain off grease and transfer sausage to a plate.
2. Cook bacon to the same pot until crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove and drain, leaving about 2 teaspoons of bacon grease in the pot. Add onion and garlic and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Return sausage and bacon back into the pot; stir in chicken broth, water, and bouillon cube. Season with pepper and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Stir in cauliflower and simmer until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Add kale and half-and-half; simmer until kale is wilted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese to serve.
