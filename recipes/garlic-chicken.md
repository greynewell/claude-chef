## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- ¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into a shallow bowl.
3. Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl.
4. Use tongs to dip chicken breasts in olive oil-garlic mixture, then coat evenly in bread crumb mixture. Transfer coated chicken to a shallow baking dish.
