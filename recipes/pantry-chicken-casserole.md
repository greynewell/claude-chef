- 1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper - stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a large casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
3. While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until their liquid is released, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in processed cheese food, diced tomatoes with juice, diced tomatoes and green chiles with juice, and mild chile peppers. Cook and stir until cheese has melted, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cooked pasta and chicken. Pour into the prepared baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Serve warm.
