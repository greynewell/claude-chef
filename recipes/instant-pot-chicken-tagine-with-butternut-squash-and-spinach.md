## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 3 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons sweet paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced lengthwise
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 4 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
- 2 ½ cups water
- 2 cups peeled and cubed (3/4-inch) butternut squash
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes in juice
- 1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach leaves
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir 2 tablespoons oil, 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, cinnamon, cumin, paprika, coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a small bowl to form a paste. Toss 1 tablespoon paste with chicken in a medium bowl.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat remaining oil until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add onion and 1 teaspoon kosher salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 6 minutes.
3. Stir in remaining spice paste, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in water, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom using a wooden spoon. Add butternut squash, tomatoes with their juices, and chicken; stir to combine, then distribute mixture in an even layer. Close and lock the lid and move the pressure valve to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 3 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Stir spinach into the pot and cover without locking the lid into place. Let stand until spinach wilts, about 3 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and zest; taste, and season with salt and pepper.
