## Ingredients

- 4  potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup oil
- 2 small onions, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons coriander seed
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2  roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped
- ½ cup frozen peas
- 4  prepared pie crusts
- 2  egg whites, beaten, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; coarsely mash.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir tomatoes and peas into onion mixture; pour into mashed potatoes and thoroughly mix. Cool completely.
4. Cut each pie crust into 8 even triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling creating a triangular 'hat' shape. Pinch the dough together to form a seal. Brush egg white over each samosa and arrange on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
