## Ingredients

- 6 (8 inch) whole wheat tortillas
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  shallots, finely chopped
- ½ pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- ¼ cup dry white wine
- 1 (15 ounce) can brown lentils
- 1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, crumbled
- ¼ cup chopped kalamata olives
- ½ cup chopped tomatoes

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil, and warm in the oven about 10 minutes, until soft.
2. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and saute the garlic, shallots, and mushrooms 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Pour in the wine, and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the saucepan. Mix in the lentils, and cook 2 minutes, just until heated through.
