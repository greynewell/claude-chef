## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon cold water
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup cider vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 12  skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer, stirring frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. Brush both sides of each thigh with the sauce. Reserve any extra sauce for basting.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
5. Flip chicken and brush with sauce. Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.
