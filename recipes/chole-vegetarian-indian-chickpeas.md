## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- 2  star anise pods, broken into pieces
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ½ cup water
- 1 teaspoon chile powder
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¾ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1  whole clove, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and anise; stir. Add chickpeas, tomato sauce, water, chile powder, garam masala, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and clove. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until chickpeas start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.
2. Mash some of the chickpeas directly in the pot to give the sauce a chunkier consistency. Cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes. Remove star anise pieces and clove before serving.
