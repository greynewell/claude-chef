## Ingredients

- 1  avocado, peeled and pitted
- ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 tablespoons reduced-fat sour cream
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound ground chicken breast
- 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers, drained
- 1  fresh jalapeno pepper, seeded if desired and finely diced
- 3  green onions, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ground black pepper to taste
- 4 slices Cheddar cheese
- 4  hamburger buns, split
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- ⅓ cup salsa

## Instructions

1. To make the guacamole, place the avocado, cilantro, sour cream, chili powder, salt, and pepper in a food processor and pulse until smooth..
2. Mix chicken, canned chiles, jalapeno pepper, green onions, oregano, salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 4 patties.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
4. Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill each patty 5 minutes per side, until well done. Move the patties to a cooler area of the grill to keep warm, and top each patty with a slice of Cheddar cheese. Lightly grill the buns while the cheese is melting.
