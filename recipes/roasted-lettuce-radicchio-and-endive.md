## Ingredients

- 2 heads   radicchio, halved lengthwise
- 2 heads   Belgian endive, halved lengthwise
- 1 head chicory (curly endive), halved lengthwise
- 1 head romaine lettuce, halved lengthwise
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking dish with parchment paper.
2. Place radicchio, Belgian endive, chicory, and romaine lettuce halves in a single layer on the baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the olive oil on top.
