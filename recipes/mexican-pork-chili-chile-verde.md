## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds fresh tomatillos, or more to taste, husks removed
- 3  serrano peppers
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 tablespoons lard
- 3 pounds pork shoulder, or more to taste, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, coarsely chopped
- ½ cup red wine
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet.
3. Place in the preheated oven and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove vegetables from oven, cool slightly, and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until smooth. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
4. While vegetables are roasting, heat lard in a Dutch oven or heavy oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with garlic salt and pepper and add to the pot in batches. Cook each batch until browned, about 7 minutes, removing to a plate with a slotted spoon. Drain and discard all but 2 tablespoons pan drippings.
5. Add onion and bell pepper to the pot. Saute, stirring occasionally, until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in browned pork, tomatillo puree, chicken stock, cilantro, oregano, cumin, and salt.
6. Cover and cook in the oven until pork is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Allow to stand for 15 minutes, covered, before serving.
