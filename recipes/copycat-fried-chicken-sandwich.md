## Ingredients

- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 dash hot sauce, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
- 4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)
- 1 large egg, beaten
- ½ cup buttermilk
- ¼ cup milk
- canola oil for frying
- 4  soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered
- 6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
- 12  dill pickle slices, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
2. Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.
3. Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined.
4. Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.
5. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.
7. Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.
