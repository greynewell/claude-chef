## Ingredients

- 1 pound white American cheese (such as Land O'Lakes®), sliced
- 1 cup half-and-half, or as needed
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons diced jalapeno pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon chili powder

## Instructions

1. Place American cheese and about 1/4 cup half-and-half in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until cheese starts to melt, about 5 minutes.
2. Slowly start stirring half-and-half into cheese mixture, about 2 tablespoons at a time, until cheese begins to melt and mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes more.
3. Continue adding more half-and-half.
4. Season cheese mixture with cumin, black pepper, and salt; add red pepper flakes, a little at a time, until desired spiciness is reached.
