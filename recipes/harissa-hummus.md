## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons harissa powder
- 3 cups low-sodium chickpeas, drained and liquid reserved
- ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more as needed
- 2 cloves garlic
- 8  Kalamata olives
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- ⅛ teaspoon harissa powder, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine harissa powder and 1 teaspoon chickpea liquid in a bowl. Whisk until a smooth paste forms, adding more liquid as needed. Set aside.
2. Reserve about 1/2 cup of whole chickpeas for garnish. Add remaining chickpeas to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1/3 cup olive oil, tahini, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and garlic; blend until smooth. Mix in reserved harissa paste and more chickpea liquid if needed, to maintain a creamy consistency. Taste and adjust olive oil and lemon juice amounts until flavor is smooth and nutty with a kick, and not overpowered by any one element.
3. Transfer hummus to a serving dish. Top with reserved 1/2 cup chickpeas, olives, cilantro, harissa powder, and any remaining olive oil. Serve at room temperature.
