## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) package dry spaghetti
- 8 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 dash cayenne pepper
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
2. Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Melt butter with garlic very slowly to avoid burning the garlic. Season with parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.
3. Add cooked pasta to the skillet and toss until well coated with butter. Increase the heat to medium and cook until pasta is heated through and has absorbed some of the butter. Adjust seasonings if necessary.
4. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.
