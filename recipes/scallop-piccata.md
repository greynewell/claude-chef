## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 3 cloves garlic, minced, divided
- 2 cups chicken broth
- ½  lemon, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger
- 1 pound sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
- 1  lemon, juiced
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
2. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Drain well.
4. Heat a skillet over medium heat.
5. Add 2 cloves minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
6. Pour in broth, scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet.
7. Stir in lemon slices and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes.
8. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced to about 2/3 cup, 5 to 8 minutes.
9. Add lemon juice and capers; simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes more.
10. Add 1 tablespoon butter and swirl it into the sauce by tilting the skillet until butter is melted and incorporated.
11. Remove skillet from heat and set sauce aside.
12. Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat.
13. Stir in remaining garlic and ginger and cook until just fragrant and softened, about 1 minute.
14. Slice any scallops that are more than 3/4-inch thick in half so they will cook evenly.
15. Stir scallops into the skillet with the garlic and ginger.
16. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm, 1 to 5 minutes; do not overcook to avoid tough scallops.
17. Stir in the juice of 1 lemon and season with salt and black pepper.
18. Pour in cream and bring mixture to a bare simmer.
19. Serve scallops and sauce over the cooked pasta; garnish with Parmesan cheese.
