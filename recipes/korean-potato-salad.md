## Ingredients

- 3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup minced carrot
- ½ medium unpeeled cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- 2  hard-boiled eggs
- ½ small red apple, cored and chopped
- 1 pinch black pepper to taste
- ⅔ cup mayonnaise (such as Duke's®)
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon finely grated ginger

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes in a large pot of salted cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add carrots during the last 3 minutes of cooking. Drain and set aside.
2. Place cucumber slices in a strainer and sprinkle with salt, coating the slices. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Thoroughly rinse cucumbers and transfer to a stack of paper towels or a dry kitchen towel. Give them a good squeeze until most of the moisture is removed. This is an important step if you don't want to end up with a runny dressing.
3. Cut hard-boiled eggs in half, and set aside 1/2 of 1 yolk. Cut egg whites and remaining yolks into small pieces.
4. Place potatoes and carrots in a large bowl. Mash gently by pressing down with the back of a spoon until mostly mashed, but still a bit chunky. Mix in chopped egg, cucumber, red onion, apple, and black pepper.
5. Whisk mayonnaise, gochujang, sesame oil, and ginger together in a bowl; fold into the potato mixture.
6. Grate reserved egg yolk over the potato salad, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.
