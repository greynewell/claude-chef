## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 2 ½ teaspoons chili powder, divided
- 2 teaspoons onion powder, divided
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder, divided
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  eggs
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 pound frozen riced cauliflower, thawed and drained
- 1 ½ cups grated Cheddar cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 11x7-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper until spiced are distributed evenly. Cook until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Whisk together eggs and cream in a bowl; add to meat mixture. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish and pat down evenly.
4. Wipe the skillet clean, add olive oil, and heat over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 teaspoon each chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cauliflower rice and continue cooking for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese, and spread on top of meat in the baking dish, smoothing with a spatula to flatten the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar over the top and bake until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool about 5 minutes. Serve warm.
