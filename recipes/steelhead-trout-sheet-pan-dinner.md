## Ingredients

- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)
- 1 medium zucchini, cut in half and sliced
- 1 medium yellow squash, sliced
- 4 ounces portobello mushrooms, quartered
- 2 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ cup pecans
- ¼ cup panko bread crumbs
- ½ teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)
- 1 pound steelhead trout fillets
- 1 tablespoon melted butter
- 1 (8.8 ounce) package long grain and wild rice (such as Uncle Ben's(R))
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray.
2. Combine olive oil and Greek seasoning in a bowl. Add zucchini, squash, mushrooms, green beans, and garlic, and toss to coat. Spread into a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the crust for the fish. Place pecans in a high-frequency blender (such as Vitamix®) and blend on high for 20 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl and mix in panko and Greek seasoning; set aside.
5. Remove vegetables from the oven and push them to one side of the sheet. Open the rice packet and carefully spread rice out on the empty side of the pan. Drizzle rice with water. Place trout fillets on top of the vegetables and rice. Brush fillets with melted butter and press panko mixture lightly into the fillets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until fish easily flakes with a fork, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately.
