## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup minced garlic
- ⅓ cup chopped green onion
- 4 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
- 20 ounces rib-eye steak, sliced thin
- salt and pepper to taste
- 3 cups uncooked glutinous (sticky) white rice, rinsed
- 6 ½ cups water
- 4  dried shiitake mushrooms
- 1 pound fresh spinach, washed and chopped
- 12 ounces cucumber, julienned
- 12 ounces carrots, julienned
- sesame oil
- 8 ounces fresh bean sprouts
- 6  eggs
- 6 sheets nori, crumbled
- 6 tablespoons sesame oil
- ¼ cup chili bean paste (Kochujang)

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, sugars, garlic, green onions, and sesame seeds in a large bowl; add sliced beef strips to marinade and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
2. Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover; simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place 6 Korean stone bowls in the oven.
4. Combine shiitake mushrooms and 1/2 cup hot water in a small bowl; soak until pliable, about 10 minutes. Trim off and discard stems. Thinly slice caps and set aside.
5. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add spinach to water just long enough to wilt leaves, then drain and pat dry. Set aside.
6. Combine cucumber and carrots in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
7. Preheat a wok over medium-high heat.
8. Cook and stir carrots and cucumbers in a small amount of sesame oil in the wok until softened. Remove from the wok and set aside. Add a small amount of sesame oil to the wok; cook and stir spinach in sesame oil for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove spinach from the wok and set aside. Add meat strips and marinade to the wok; cook, stirring frequently, until liquid reduces in volume, about 4 to 5 minutes.
9. Transfer the stone bowls from the oven to a suitable heat-resistant surface. Brush each bowl with sesame oil to coat. Divide rice into the bowls and gently pack to the bottom (the rice should sizzle as you arrange). Arrange cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and beef mixture over each portion of rice.
10. Add one fried egg to each bowl, drizzle with 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and top with nori. Serve Kochujang sauce as a condiment.
