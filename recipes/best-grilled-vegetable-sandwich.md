## Ingredients

- ½  zucchini, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
- ½ small eggplant, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
- 1  red bell pepper, quartered
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons olive oil
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 small whole-grain baguette, cut into two halves and split lengthwise
- ¼ cup basil pesto
- 4 ounces fresh baby mozzarella, sliced
