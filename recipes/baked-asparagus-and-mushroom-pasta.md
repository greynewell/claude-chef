## Ingredients

- ½ (16 ounce) package gemelli pasta
- 2 tablespoons herb-infused extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- 1 pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups 1% milk
- ⅔ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided
- ¼ cup shredded provolone cheese
- ⅓ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook gemelli at a boil until flexible but still firm to the bite, about 6 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and stir for 2 minutes. Add asparagus and mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to soften and asparagus is bright green, about 4 minutes.
4. Add tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Pour the vegetable mixture into a large mixing bowl. Drain pasta and stir into the bowl.
6. Melt butter in the same skillet. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes. Pour in milk, stirring briskly to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until sauce thickens and bubbles again, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and provolone cheese until melted.
7. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and vegetables and stir to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Taste and adjust seasonings. Toss remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano with bread crumbs and sprinkle over the casserole.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
