## Ingredients

- 2 (1/2 pound) New York strip steaks, sliced into thin strips
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 ½ teaspoons white sugar
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  sweet onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound snow peas
- ¾ cup green peas
- 1  carrot, sliced
- 2 stalks celery, sliced
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and cut into chunks
- ¼ cup oil for deep frying

## Instructions

1. Place sliced steak in a large bowl; sprinkle cornstarch over top and toss to coat.
2. Whisk soy sauce and sugar together in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; pour over the steak. Mix and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in oyster sauce and season with salt and pepper.
4. Add snow peas, green peas, carrot, celery, and bell pepper; cook and stir until vegetables are crisp-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove vegetables from the skillet.
5. Remove steak from the marinade, shaking off any excess moisture; discard the marinade.
6. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet. Fry steak in the hot skillet to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium. Add the vegetables back to the skillet; mix well and cook until just heated through. Serve hot.
