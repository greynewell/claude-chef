## Ingredients

- 3 cups uncooked mafalda pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1 small yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1 small red bell pepper, diced
- 8  cherry tomatoes
- ¼ cup Italian green olives
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- ¼ cup grated Grana Padano cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until flexible but not soft, about 5 minutes. Drain.
3. Heat oil in a stovetop- and oven-safe casserole dish over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken strips until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add onion, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, olives, thyme, lemon zest, and pepper flakes. Cook and stir until the onions have begun to look translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the half-cooked pasta.
4. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano over the pasta mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the cheeses have melted and browned, about 15 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
