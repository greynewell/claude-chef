- ½ cup toasted sliced almonds
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
- 1 cup low-fat vanilla Greek yogurt (such as Cabot™)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.
2. Combine almonds, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon zest, 1 tablespoon orange zest, honey, and almond extract in a small mixing bowl until crumbly. Set topping aside.
3. Stir melted butter, 2 tablespoons lemon zest, and 1 tablespoon orange zest together in a small bowl. Stir yogurt, 1 cup sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract together in another small bowl until evenly blended.
4. Whisk flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Add butter and yogurt mixtures. Beat with an electric hand mixer on low speed until just combined.
5. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each almost to the top. Spoon on the almond topping and sprinkle with turbinado sugar.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan and allow to cool on a wire rack.
