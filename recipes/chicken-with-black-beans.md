## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cubed
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk together the light soy sauce, cornstarch, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add the chicken breast and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
