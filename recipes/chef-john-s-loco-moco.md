## Ingredients

- 2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ cups beef stock
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 drops sesame oil, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons ketchup
- 2 teaspoons white sugar  (Optional)
- 4 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups hot cooked white rice

## Instructions

1. Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne; set aside.
2. Whisk together beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, cornstarch, ketchup, sugar, and sesame oil in a bowl; set aside.
3. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 5 minutes. Flip patties; add green onions and cook until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove patties and most of green onions to a plate.
4. Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.
5. Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.
6. Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over rice, spoon gravy on top, and add fried eggs.
