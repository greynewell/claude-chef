## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup apple juice
- ⅔ cup Pinot Grigio wine
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon herbes de Provence
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 8 medium boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup onion slices
- 4 medium Apples, raw
- ⅔ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Combine apple juice, white wine, Dijon mustard, garlic, ginger, and herbes de Provence in a small container; set aside.
2. Melt butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and brown chicken thighs, about 3 minutes per side. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle onion slices over chicken thighs, add apple slices, and pour cooking liquid on top. Bring mixture to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to a simmer.
3. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken, apples, and onions to a serving dish and keep warm.
4. Bring liquid to a boil over medium-high heat. Allow liquid to boil and reduce down to about 1 1/2 cups, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and cook until sauce has thickened and is well blended.
5. Pour sauce over chicken, apples, and onions and serve.
