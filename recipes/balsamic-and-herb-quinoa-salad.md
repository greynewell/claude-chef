## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
- ½ cup frozen baby lima beans
- water to cover
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ⅓ cup slivered almonds
- 3  Campari tomatoes, diced
- 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions
- 2 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into small chunks
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 3 tablespoons almond oil
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Bring 2 cups water, quinoa, and bouillon granules to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Spread quinoa onto a baking sheet and refrigerate until cooled, about 30 minutes. Rinse the saucepan.
2. Place lima beans into the saucepan and add water to cover beans by 1 inch; season with salt and pepper. Cover the saucepan with a lid and bring water to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until beans are cooked through but still tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain water and rinse beans under cold water to stop the cooking process; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes.
3. Cook and stir almonds in a skillet over medium heat until toasted, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and cool almonds to room temperature, about 5 minutes.
4. Mix quinoa, lima beans, almonds, tomatoes, scallions, and mozzarella cheese together in a large bowl.
5. Whisk vinegar, almond oil, olive oil, Italian seasoning, basil, garlic, and salt together in a small bowl until smooth; pour over quinoa mixture and stir to coat.
