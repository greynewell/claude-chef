## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package dried penne pasta
- 5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes
- salt and pepper to taste
- garlic powder to taste
- ½ cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 bunch slender asparagus spears, trimmed, cut on diagonal into 1-inch pieces
- 1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
- ¼ cup Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chicken and season with 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is cooked through and browned, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken to a paper towel-lined plate.
3. Pour chicken broth into the skillet. Stir in asparagus, sliced garlic, and another pinch garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and steam until asparagus is just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Stir chicken mixture into pasta and mix well. Let sit for about 5 minutes. Drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, stir again, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
