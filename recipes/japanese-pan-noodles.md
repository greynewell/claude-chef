## Ingredients

- 1 (10 ounce) package fresh udon noodles
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil, divided, or to taste
- 2 cups chopped broccoli
- ½  green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks
- 2 small carrots, cut into matchsticks, or to taste
- ½  zucchini, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- 1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce
- ¾ teaspoon minced ginger

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil.
2. Heat the remaining sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook broccoli until bright green and still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper and carrots; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini; cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes more. Add soy sauce, mirin, chili-garlic sauce, and ginger; stir to combine. Mix in the noodles; cook and stir until noodles absorb some of the sauce, 1 to 2 minutes more.
