## Ingredients

- ½ cup cornstarch
- ¼ cup water
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- ½ cup hot chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
- 3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite size pieces
- ½ cup soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1  egg
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 2 cups chopped green onions

## Instructions

1. To Make Sauce: In a large bowl combine 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water. Mix together. Add garlic, ginger, sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce and white wine vinegar. Then add chicken broth and monosodium glutamate and stir all together until sugar dissolves. Refrigerate until needed.
2. To Prepare Chicken: In a separate bowl, combine chicken, 1/2 cup soy sauce and white pepper. Stir in egg. Add 1 cup cornstarch and stir until chicken is evenly coated. Add oil to help separate chicken pieces. Divide chicken into small quantities and deep fry at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until crispy. Drain on paper towels.
3. To Make Mixture: Place a small amount of oil in wok and heat until wok is hot. Add scallions and dried chile peppers and stir-fry briefly. Remove sauce from refrigerator and stir.
