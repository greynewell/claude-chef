## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds flat iron steak
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon chile paste
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  serving cooking spray
- 1  onion, sliced
- 1 (8 ounce) package sugar snap peas
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal

## Instructions

1. Slice steak across the grain as thinly as possible. Place soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, ginger, sesame oil, chile paste, sesame seeds, and garlic in a large bowl; mix well. Add steak and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove steak from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.
