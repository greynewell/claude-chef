## Ingredients

- 3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- kosher salt to taste
- 1 (24 fluid ounce) bottle tomatillo-based salsa verde
- ½ (4 ounce) can chopped roasted green chiles
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 large jalapeno pepper, seeded and sliced
- ½ cup lightly packed cilantro leaves and stems
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¾ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
- 2 (15 ounce) cans white kidney beans, drained and rinsed

## Instructions

1. Season chicken thighs with salt on both sides.
2. Transfer 1/2 the chicken to a dry, nonstick skillet over high heat. Cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl. Brown the rest of the chicken. Let cool to room temperature before cutting.
3. Combine salsa verde, green chilies, garlic, jalapeno, and cilantro in a blender. Blend, starting on low and finishing on high, until sauce is very smooth and bright green.
4. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and transfer back into the bowl. Combine chicken pieces, accumulated juices, and the green sauce into a pot. Season with cumin, chipotle pepper, black pepper, oregano, and salt.
5. Rinse out blender with a splash of water and pour into the pot. Mix together and set heat to medium-high. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until chicken is tender, depending on size of chicken pieces, about 1 hour. Stir in kidney beans and simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes.
