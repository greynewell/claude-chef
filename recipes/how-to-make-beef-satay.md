## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons ground coriander
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1  2-inch piece of fresh lemon grass (white part only)
- 2 pounds beef top sirloin, trimmed
- 4 12-inch long metal skewers

## Instructions

1. Whisk together brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, onion, oil, soy sauce, coriander, ginger, cumin, turmeric, and cayenne pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth.
2. Bruise lemongrass by hitting it lightly several times with the back of a large chef's knife; mince lemongrass and add to marinade.
3. Cut beef sirloin into strips about 2 1/2-inches long and 1/8 inch-thick. Stir beef into marinade until beef is completely coated, about 1 minute. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly oil the grate.
5. Remove beef from marinade and shake off excess marinade. Thread 1/4 of the meat onto each metal skewer. Discard remaining marinade.
6. Arrange skewers on the preheated grill; cook until meat stops sticking to the grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip skewers and continue cooking until meat is well browned and shows grill marks, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes. Flip skewers once more; cook until meat is still slightly pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer skewers to a platter; let rest for 2 minutes before serving.
