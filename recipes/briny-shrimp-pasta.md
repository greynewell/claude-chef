## Ingredients

- ¾ pound medium shrimp, shelled and deveined, shells reserved
- ½ tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 4 tablespoons prepared basil pesto, or to taste
- 3 tablespoons diced oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, oil reserved
- 3 tablespoons capers
- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- ½ cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 3 tablespoons sour cream
- 1 pinch freshly cracked black pepper to taste
- 5 leaves fresh basil, chopped, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Throw shrimp shells into a large pot of well salted water. Bring to a boil while preparing the sauce.
2. Combine olive oil and garlic in a cold pan. Cook over medium heat until garlic is fragrant but not yet browned, about 1 minute. Add bell pepper and red pepper flakes. Fry, tossing constantly, for another minute. Stir in the pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and capers. Cook and stir until capers start to burst, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
3. Meanwhile, add angel hair pasta to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Stir shrimp into the sauce and add some pasta water; reduce to your liking, about 2 minutes.
5. Drain pasta, reserving the water. Transfer pasta to the sauce; add cheese and sour cream. Stir until mixture starts to combine and pour in more pasta water as desired. Season with pepper. Remove from heat and stir in basil before serving.
