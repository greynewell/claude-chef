## Ingredients

- 1 slice of bread. White or wheat only. Don't be a jerk.
- Another slice of bread. Same kind as before.
- Peanut butter. Crunchy preferred. Choosey moms choose Jif.
- Jelly. NOT JAM! Preserves are ok. Grape or strawberry. Don't make it weird.

## Instructions

1. Toast both slices of bread to preference.
2. Using a butter knife spread PB on one slice.
3. Wipe the butter knife, you savage.
4. Using the same butter knife spread jelly on other slice.
5. Place slices together and place on paper towel or paper plate for 60-90 seconds or until PB begins to soften.
6. Enjoy in as few bites as possible.

## Notes

Don't try to be fancy. This recipe is perfect as-is. No substitutions. No thinking you've got a better idea. Just follow the directions and be thankful.
