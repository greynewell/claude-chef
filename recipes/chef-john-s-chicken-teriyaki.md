## Ingredients

- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup sake
- ½ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 3  green onions, chopped, white and dark green parts separated
- 2 teaspoons finely grated ginger
- 10  skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, sake, mirin, brown sugar, white parts of green onions, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until sugar dissolves and marinade flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
2. Pour marinade into a bowl and cool to room temperature.
3. Pour 1/2 the marinade into a resealable plastic bag.
4. Add chicken thighs, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.
5. Marinate in the refrigerator, 30 minutes to 1 hour.
6. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
7. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with vegetable oil.
8. Arrange chicken thighs on prepared baking sheet.
9. Discard excess marinade.
10. Broil chicken in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.
11. Flip thighs and broil for 5 minutes more.
12. Flip thighs again and brush each thigh with reserved marinade.
13. Continue to broil, brushing with reserved marinade every 1 to 2 minutes, until cooked through, about 12 minutes.
14. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
15. Garnish with dark green parts of green onions.
