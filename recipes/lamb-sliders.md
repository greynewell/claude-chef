## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 8 small slider-size rolls, split
- 1 cup baby spinach
- ½ cup tzatziki sauce
- ¼ cup sliced red onion
- ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Mix garlic, cumin, coriander, allspice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add lamb and mix well. Form mixture into 2-ounce patties.
3. Grill patties on the preheated grill until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place rolls on the grill and heat until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes.
