## Ingredients

- 8  cannelloni noodles
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 5  shallots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup dry sherry
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms
- 1  zucchini, chopped
- 1  small eggplant, diced
- 2  roasted red bell peppers, diced
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¾ cup ricotta cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. In a large pot of salted water, parboil cannelloni. (Parboiling is partially cooking the noodles in boiling water; they will finish cooking when baked.)
2. Meanwhile, cook 2 cloves garlic and 2 shallots in 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat for 30 seconds. Pour in sherry, raise heat to high, and reduce liquid by half. Stir in cream, and reduce until there is about 1 1/2 cups liquid. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set cream sauce aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat one tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Cook onion, 3 shallots, 3 cloves garlic, mushrooms, zucchini, and eggplant in olive oil until all vegetables are tender. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in red peppers, basil, oregano, ricotta, and Parmesan cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set filling aside.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch baking dish. Stuff vegetable/cheese filling into cannelloni. Place in prepared baking dish, and cover with cream sauce.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.
