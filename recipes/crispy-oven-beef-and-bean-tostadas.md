## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ pound ground beef
- ½ cup chopped sweet onion, or more to taste
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 6  corn tortillas
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 cups refried beans
- 2 cups shredded lettuce, or as desired
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1  tomato, diced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Mix garlic salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and black pepper together in a small bowl.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Keep warm while preparing tostada shells.
4. Brush oil over both sides of tortillas and arrange on a baking sheet.
5. Bake tortillas in preheated oven until crisped on top, about 5 minutes. Flip tortillas and continue baking until other side crisps, 2 to 3 minutes more.
6. Heat refried beans in a saucepan over medium-low, stirring regularly until hot, about 5 minutes (see Cook's Note).
7. Divide refried beans between tostadas and spread over one side of each; spoon ground beef mixture over the beans. Top each tostada with lettuce, Cheddar cheese, and diced tomato.
