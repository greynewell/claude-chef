## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons dry egg replacer (such as Bob's Red Mill®)
- ¾ cup water, divided
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon coconut extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 (11.5 fl oz) can sweetened condensed coconut milk (such as A Taste of Thai® Sweetened Condensed Coconut Milk)
- 1 cup dairy-free heavy whipping cream (such as Silk®)
- ½ cup cream of coconut (such as Coco Lopez®)
- ½ tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ tablespoon coconut extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x7-inch baking pan.
2. Mix egg replacer with 1/2 cup water in a bowl. Add sugar and beat with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in remaining 1/4 cup water, vanilla extract, and coconut extract. Add flour, baking powder, and salt, beating until batter is smooth. Pour into the baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Cool for 1 hour on a wire rack.
4. Combine sweetened condensed coconut milk, dairy-free heavy whipping cream, cream of coconut, vanilla, and coconut extract in a bowl for the tres leches sauce.
5. Poke holes into the top of the cooled cake with a skewer. Pour sauce over the cake using a large spoon, allowing it to soak into the holes. Cover and refrigerate until most of the sauce is absorbed, at least 4 hours.
