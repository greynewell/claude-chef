## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons fish sauce
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup chopped broccoli
- ¼  yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 3  crimini mushrooms, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  large eggs

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic powder, and ginger in a small bowl until sugar dissolves; set sauce aside.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat; cook and stir shrimp in hot oil until they begin to turn reddish-pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broccoli, onion, and mushrooms; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
4. Push shrimp and vegetables to one side of the skillet. Cook eggs in the clear space in the skillet, scrambling lightly, until no longer wet, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir together cooked eggs, shrimp, and vegetables until combined. Add spaghetti and sauce; cook and stir until hot and evenly mixed, about 2 minutes more.
