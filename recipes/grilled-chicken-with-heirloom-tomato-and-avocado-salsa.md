## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon chili powder
- 2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 medium ripe avocado, diced
- 1 medium heirloom tomato, seeded and diced
- ½ small red onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon lime juice, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Combine onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and chili powder in a small bowl. Sprinkle chicken with spice mixture and rub until evenly coated. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
3. Arrange chicken on the preheated grill and grill for 8 minutes. Turn and grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
4. Remove chicken from the grill and drizzle with remaining olive oil. Let stand for 10 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, mix avocado, tomato, and red onion for salsa together in a small bowl. Add lime juice and season with salt and pepper.
6. Slice chicken and top with salsa.
