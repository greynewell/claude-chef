3. Transfer shrimp to a large piece of aluminum foil, fold the foil over the shrimp, and fold the edges over several times to make a packet.
4. Cut several slits in the top of the aluminum packet.
5. Place the aluminum packet of shrimp onto the rack in the smoker.
6. Place remaining lime half onto the rack.
7. Smoke the shrimp and lime until shrimp are cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes.

9. Squeeze the juice from the smoked lime over the shrimp.
10. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat.
