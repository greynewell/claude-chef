## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ tablespoons crushed red pepper
- 1 ½ cups Chardonnay white wine
- 1 cup clam juice
- 6 cups marinara sauce
- 8 leaves fresh basil, coarsely chopped
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ⅓ pound scallops
- 3 whole lobster tails, shelled, cleaned, and chopped
- 24 medium mussels mussels, cleaned and debearded
- 24 medium (blank)s littleneck clams, scrubbed
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour olive oil into a large pan over medium heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook until fragrant, 30 to 40 seconds. Pour in white wine and increase heat to medium-high. Let wine reduce by half, about 8 minutes. Add clam juice and reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in marinara, basil, and salt. Let simmer to let flavors marry, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. Add shrimp, scallops, lobster, mussels, and clams to the sauce and cook until clams and mussels open, scallops are opaque, shrimp is pink, and lobster is red on the outside and opaque on the inside, 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Toss linguine in sauce until it's thick enough to coat the noodles (it will still be a relatively thin sauce), about 3 minutes.
5. Plate noodles and load up with seafood and sauce. Garnish with parsley, and serve immediately with Parmesan cheese.
