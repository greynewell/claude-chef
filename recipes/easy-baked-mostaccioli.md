## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 ½ (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook mostaccioli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
3. Meanwhile, heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce to the pan and mix with the beef.
4. Transfer beef mixture to the prepared baking dish. Spread evenly over the bottom and layer cooked pasta over top. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover with foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 10 more minutes.
