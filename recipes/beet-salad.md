## Ingredients

- 4 bunches fresh small beets, stems removed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- salt and pepper to taste
- 2 medium heads Belgian endive
- 1 pound spring lettuce mix
