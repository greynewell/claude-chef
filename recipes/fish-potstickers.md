## Ingredients

- 1 pound whitefish fillets, skinned and deboned
- 2  carrots, chopped
- 6  scallions, chopped
- 1  large egg white
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons cilantro leaves
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons chile oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 (16 ounce) package 3-inch round wonton wrappers
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add fish. Cook, flipping halfway, until lightly browned and flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 10 minutes.
2. Place 1/2 the fish in a food processor. Add carrots, scallions, egg white, soy sauce, cilantro, garlic, sesame oil, chile oil, salt, ginger, and black pepper. Process until a paste forms; transfer to a bowl. Roughly chop remaining fish and add to the bowl.
3. Place 1 tablespoon fish paste into the center of a wonton wrapper. Moisten the edge with water; fold wrapper over the filling and press to seal, making pleats along the edge of the dumpling. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. Cover dumplings with a damp kitchen towel to keep from drying out.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange 1/2 the dumplings tightly together in the skillet. Cook until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup hot water, cover, and cook until water has mostly evaporated and dumplings are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, uncover, and cook until remaining water evaporates, about 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dumplings.
