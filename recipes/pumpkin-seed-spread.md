## Ingredients

- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 8  peeled garlic cloves, halved or quartered depending on size
- 2 cups green (hulled) pumpkin seeds
- ½ cup diced onion
- 2 tablespoons diced green serrano or jalapeno chilies
- ¾ cup apple juice
- 2  limes, juiced
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- ½ cup apple juice or water, to adjust texture of spread
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place garlic pieces in a cold, dry skillet. Add vegetable oil. Cook garlic on low heat until it starts to soften but does not get brown, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. When garlic is tender, remove skillet from heat; let garlic cool in the oil.
2. Place pumpkin seeds in a cold, dry skillet. Set heat to medium. Stir seeds until hot and fragrant but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer to a bowl.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Add onion and Serrano pepper. Cool until edges start to brown and some bits begin to char, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in apple juice. Reduce heat to medium and cook until liquid is reduced almost all the way and has a syrup-like consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Place pumpkin seeds, cilantro leaves, onion mixture, softened garlic and oil, lime juice, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Cover and pulse on and off until mixture becomes a coarse paste, scraping down sides with a spatula a few times, 1 or 2 minutes. If mixture is quite thick, add a few tablespoons of apple juice or water (apple juice will make it sweeter).
5. Continue to process until mixture is to your desired consistency. Transfer to a bowl. Cover; refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours. Taste, and adjust seasonings and acidity as needed with additional salt and/or apple cider vinegar.
