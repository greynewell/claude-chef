## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
- 2 tablespoons chile-garlic paste
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 10  boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, peanut butter, hoisin sauce, ginger, garlic, and chile paste in a resealable container. Mix well. Stir in cornstarch. Add chicken to marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
