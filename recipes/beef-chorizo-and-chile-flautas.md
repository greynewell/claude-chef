## Ingredients

- 7 peppers Anaheim chile peppers
- 2 pounds ground chuck
- ⅓ pound bulk chorizo sausage
- ¼ cup canola oil, or as needed
- 2 ½ (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles light beer
- ¾ cup salsa
- 2 tablespoons ground ancho chile powder
- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 24 (8 inch) flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place peppers, cut-sides down, onto the prepared baking sheet.
2. Roast peppers in the preheated oven until the skins are brown and crispy, about 15 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins. Dice flesh and set aside.
3. Combine ground chuck and chorizo in a bowl, kneading together as evenly as possible.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pot over medium heat. Add meat and cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Strain out 90% of the grease.
5. Stir beer, salsa, chile powder, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, salt, marjoram, black pepper, and cayenne into the meat. Stir in 1/2 of the diced chile peppers. Crank up the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until most of the liquid has disappeared, about 2 hours; don't let all the liquid evaporate or you'll have dry meat.
6. Brush one side of a tortilla with some of the remaining canola oil. On the dry side, about 1/2 inch from one side of the tortilla, spoon a line of beef and chorizo, sprinkle with Colby-Jack cheese, and top with some diced chile peppers. Roll the loaded side over multiple times until the tortilla is in a tight roll. Make sure it is tight by tucking the first rotation up under the meat. Set rolled tortilla seam-side down on the wire rack of an air fryer. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
7. Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
8. Fry in the preheated air fryer for 6 minutes. Serve immediately.
