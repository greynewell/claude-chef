## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups brown sugar
- ½ cup kosher salt
- ⅓ cup ground black pepper
- ¼ cup ground paprika
- ¼ cup garlic powder
- ¼ cup Italian seasoning
- 2 tablespoons onion powder
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- ½ cup apple cider
- ¼ cup apple juice concentrate
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 3 drops liquid smoke flavoring
- 7 pounds bone-in pork butt
- ½ cup yellow mustard
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 cup whiskey barrel wood chips (such as Jack Daniel's®)
- ½ cup apple wood chips
- ½ cup apple juice concentrate
- ½ cup water

## Instructions

1. Combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic, Italian seasoning, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, and sage in a small container. Measure 1 tablespoon of the dry rub mixture into a large container that will fit the pork butt. Refrigerate remaining dry rub.
2. Mix apple cider, 1/4 cup apple juice concentrate, 2 tablespoons honey, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke into the large container to make marinade.
3. Score top of pork butt in a checkerboard pattern. Inject some of the marinade into the bottom, sides, and top of the pork butt. Place pork in the container with the remaining marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
4. Combine whiskey barrel wood chips, apple wood chips, 1/2 cup apple juice concentrate, and water in a large resealable bag. Seal and let soak, about 20 minutes.
5. Preheat an electric smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Fill smoker box with wood chips according to manufacturer's instructions.
6. Remove pork from marinade; rub mustard and 1 tablespoon honey evenly on top. Coat pork butt heavily with dry rub. Place fat-side up on a rack.
7. Place the rack in the smoker; cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) for medium or 170 degrees F (77 degrees C), 4 to 6 hours. Add additional soaked wood chips halfway through cooking time.
8. Place pork butt fat-side up on a large platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 20 minutes, turning over halfway through resting time.
