## Ingredients

- 24 large mushrooms, stems removed, or more as needed
- 1 pound bulk hot Italian sausage
- 1  onion, diced
- 4 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- ¼ cup Italian bread crumbs
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Hollow out each mushroom cap, reserving the scrapings.
3. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, onion, and reserved mushroom scrapings until sausage is browned and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain and discard grease; return the sausage mixture to the skillet.
4. Stir 3 ounces Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, garlic, and parsley into the sausage mixture. Cook and stir until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Stuff each mushroom cap with the sausage mixture and place on a baking sheet.
