## Ingredients

- 6 ounces spiral pasta
- 2 pounds chicken meat, cut into strips
- 1 (.7 ounce) package Italian dressing mix
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder

## Instructions

2. Sprinkle chicken with Italian dressing mix and garlic powder.
3. Pan-fry chicken in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, cooking in batches if necessary, until the juices run clear and chicken meat is no longer pink in the middle, about 10 minutes per batch. Turn chicken pieces over after about 5 minutes of cooking.
