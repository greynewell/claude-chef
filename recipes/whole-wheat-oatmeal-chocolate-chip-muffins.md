## Ingredients

- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- ¾ cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
- 1 large egg
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup old-fashioned oats
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. Cream butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl. Add yogurt, egg, and vanilla; beat until smooth.
3. Mix flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Gradually beat dry ingredients into the creamed mixture until well mixed. Stir in oats and chocolate chips. Distribute the batter evenly between the 12 muffin cups, filling each at least 3/4 full.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of one of the muffins comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool the muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes before removing the muffins to cool on the rack completely.
