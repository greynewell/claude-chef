## Ingredients

- 2 cups long-grain white rice
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil, or to taste

- 2 teaspoons chile paste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place rice in a large baking dish. Drizzle in canola and sesame oils; toss to coat rice completely. Add garlic, green onions, bell peppers, carrots, peas, and ham. Season with salt. Stir until well combined.
