## Ingredients

- 3 pounds pork back ribs, separated and fat trimmed
- 1 (12.5 ounce) can pineapple tidbits, drained
- 1 cup apricot jam
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange ribs in a single layer in a roasting pan.
2. Stir pineapple, jam, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; pour over ribs.
