## Ingredients

- 1 cup packed fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts
- ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon cornmeal  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Start the dough: Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large bowl. Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make the pesto: Process basil, lemon juice, and garlic in a food processor until smooth. Pour olive oil in slowly, with the processor running, until pesto thickens. Add Parmesan cheese, walnuts, and kosher salt; process for 20 seconds. Refrigerate for 1 hour to allow flavors to combine.
3. Finish the dough: Whisk flour and kosher salt together in a bowl. Gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture, along with olive oil; stir until just combined. If the dough is sticking to the sides of the bowl, add more flour.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Form dough into a ball and place into a lightly oiled bowl. Turn dough over so all sides are oiled. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and let sit until dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.
5. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently stretch and elongate dough into a 12x18-inch rectangle. Spread pesto over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Starting at the long edge, gently roll dough around pesto. Pinch the seam to seal.
6. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
7. Place rolled dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a pastry cutter or sharp knife to cut the roll in half lengthwise. Turn dough so the cut edges are facing up. Keeping the cut edges up, gently crisscross the dough. Form into a round or oval wreath shape and pinch the edges to seal. Let rest for 30 minutes.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.
9. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.
