## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- ½  red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup frozen corn
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided, or more to taste
- 1 cup salsa
- 1 cup cornmeal
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup milk
- 2  eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and red bell pepper; saute until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ground beef, garlic, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Mix corn into the beef mixture and toss to defrost, about 3 minutes. Drain and discard fat. Add about 1/4 of the shredded Mexican cheese blend and mix well. Pour meat sauce into a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cover meat with a thin layer of salsa.
4. Combine cornmeal, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add milk and eggs; stir until well blended. Pour cornmeal mixture on top of salsa layer and top with remaining shredded Mexican cheese blend.
