## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup lite soy sauce
- ¼ cup oyster sauce
- 2 (12 ounce) cans low-sodium canned luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 ½ cups water
- 2 cups medium-grain white rice (such as Calrose)
- 6 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 (1.2 ounce) package roasted and seasoned seaweed, torn into 1 1/2-inch pieces

1. Mix sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a resealable gallon-size bag. Add luncheon meat, seal bag, and turn to coat, gently squeezing to coat luncheon meat. Marinate for at least 1 hour.
