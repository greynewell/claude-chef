## Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded green cabbage
- ½ cup apple cider vinegar
- ½ cup water, or more as needed
- ½  onion, thinly sliced
- 1  carrot, grated
- ¼ teaspoon ground oregano
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- salt to taste
- 3 cups masa harina flour (Mexican corn masa mix)
- 1 ½ cups water, or more as needed
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, or more to taste
- 1  scallion, finely chopped, or more to taste
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add cabbage and cook uncovered until slightly softened, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain.
2. Mix cabbage, apple cider vinegar, water, onion, carrot, oregano, red pepper flakes, and 1 pinch salt together in a large bowl. Refrigerate until flavors combine, 8 hours to overnight.
3. Combine masa harina, water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a large bowl; knead until a smooth, moist dough forms. Add water if dough cracks when you press down on it. Let dough rest, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, heavy cream, and scallion together in a bowl to make a paste.
5. Divide dough into 8 balls. Press your thumb into the center of each ball to form an indentation. Fill indentations with ricotta cheese paste. Pinch edges together around the filling; flatten and smooth into round 1/4 inch-thick patties between your palms.
6. Grease a skillet with cooking spray; preheat over medium heat. Cook pupusas in batches until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
7. Drain cabbage mixture and serve alongside pupusas.
