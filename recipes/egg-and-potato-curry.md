## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2  onions, peeled and quartered
- 3  tomatoes, quartered
- 2  small green chile peppers
- 2 teaspoons garlic paste
- 2 teaspoons ginger paste
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- salt to taste
- 2 cups water
- 1  large potato - cooked, peeled, and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 6  hard-cooked eggs, quartered
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions; cook and stir until onion pieces are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden, about 10 minutes more.
2. Remove pan from heat and set it aside. Transfer cooked onions to the bowl of a food processor; grind onions, tomatoes, and green chiles into a smooth paste.
3. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add onion mixture carefully, as it may spatter. Cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until the oil begins to separate from the mixture, about 5 minutes.
4. Pour water into skillet and bring sauce to a boil. Add cubed potatoes. Gently stir in the eggs. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Garnish with cilantro before serving.
