## Ingredients

- 4 ears corn, with husks
- ½  lime, juiced, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- 5 ounces crumbled cotija cheese
- ¼ cup packed chopped fresh cilantro
- 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 pinch ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Grill corn in the husks on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, to desired tenderness, about 15 minutes; some charring is fine. Remove from the grill. Remove and discard husks and silk when cool enough to handle. Cut kernels off into a medium bowl.
