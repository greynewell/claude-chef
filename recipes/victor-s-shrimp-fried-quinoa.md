## Ingredients

- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 bunch green onions, sliced
- 1 cup corn kernels
- 1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp
- 1 cup thawed frozen peas
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- ½ cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan; add quinoa and place cover on saucepan. Reduce heat to low and cook quinoa at a simmer until the moisture is completely absorbed, 18 to 20 minutes.
2. While the quinoa steams, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook green onions in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir corn into onions, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking until corn is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir the peas into the mixture and cook just until the peas are hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Stir cooked quinoa into the shrimp mixture. Return heat to medium. Pour soy sauce and sesame oil over the mixture; cook and stir until completely hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle cilantro over the dish to serve.
