## Ingredients

- 16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta
- ¼ cup pesto
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- ½ cup fresh sliced mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound scallops
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. In a large pot with boiling salted water cook fettuccini pasta until al dente. Drain. Stir in pesto sauce and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, saute onion and garlic in 3 tablespoons olive oil until soft. Add green bell pepper, mushrooms and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in dry white wine, lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, and bring to a boil. Add scallops and toss for 2 minutes.
