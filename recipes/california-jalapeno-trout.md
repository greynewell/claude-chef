## Ingredients

- 4  whole trout, cleaned
- 3 medium fresh jalapeno pepper, chopped
- 4 medium green onions, chopped
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped
- ½ cup bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup peeled, diced ripe mango
- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- garlic salt to taste
- black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat a grill for medium heat, and place the rack 3 inches over the coals.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the green onions, cilantro, bell pepper, mango, olive oil, lime juice, garlic salt, and black pepper; set aside.
3. Lightly coat four squares of foil with olive oil or cooking spray.
4. Place fish diagonally on the foil, and stuff each with 1/4 of the mango stuffing.
5. If it doesn't all fit inside the fish, then just place the remainder on top of the fish.
