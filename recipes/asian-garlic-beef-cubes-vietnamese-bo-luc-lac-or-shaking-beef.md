- 1 teaspoon soy sauce  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce  (Optional)
- 2 drops sesame oil, or more to taste

- 1 tablespoon lemon juice  (Optional)

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce (such as Maekrua®)

## Instructions

1. Put beef cubes in a container with a lid. Whisk 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 4 minced garlic cloves, wine, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, 1 teaspoon black pepper, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until marinade is well mixed; pour over beef. Allow beef to marinate, 10 to 30 minutes.
2. Whisk 1 tablespoon fish sauce, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon black pepper together in a bowl until dipping sauce is well mixed.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat; add beef and marinade.
