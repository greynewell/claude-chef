## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
- ½ cup chopped sweet onion
- 4  green onions, or to taste, chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup chunky salsa
- 12  corn tortillas
- 1 cup shredded pepperjack cheese, divided
- 2 ½ cups enchilada sauce
- 4 ounces sliced black olives

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in seasoning mix until combined. Transfer beef mixture to a large bowl, reserving drippings in the skillet.
3. Add sweet and green onions to the pan drippings; cook and stir over medium heat until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Add onions to the beef mixture, along with cream cheese and salsa; stir until cream cheese is completely melted.
5. Arrange tortillas on a large, flat work surface. Divide beef mixture evenly among tortillas, spooning it in a line down the center of each tortilla. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon pepper Jack cheese onto each tortilla, then roll tortilla up over the filling. Transfer to a baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce evenly over enchiladas, then sprinkle olives and remaining cheese over top.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts completely, about 20 minutes.
