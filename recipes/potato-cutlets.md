## Ingredients

- 5  medium-size potatoes, washed thoroughly
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons garam masala
- 2 tablespoons coriander powder
- 2 tablespoons black pepper
- 10  cilantro leaves, chopped
- 6 tablespoons bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Place unpeeled potatoes in a large saucepan, fill with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are soft and tender. Drain, cool, and peel potatoes.
