- 1  tomato
- 3  dried guajillo chile peppers, seeded
- 2  dried ancho chile peppers, seeded
- 1  pineapple, sliced 3/4-inch thick
- ½ cup orange juice
- 1  onion, quartered
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- 2  chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 1 tablespoon salt, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook tomato on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool until easily handled. Peel off skin and remove seeds.
2. Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add guajillo and ancho chile peppers; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.
3. Combine tomato flesh, softened chile peppers, 2 slices pineapple, orange juice, quartered onion, vinegar, chipotle peppers, salt, garlic, cloves, cumin seeds, and oregano in a blender; blend until smooth.
4. Arrange pork slices in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Pour blended mixture over pork, ensuring all sides are evenly coated. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap.
5. Marinate pork in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
6. Cook remaining pineapple slices on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened and soft, about 5 minutes per side. Chop into small pieces.
7. Wipe out grill pan and preheat over medium-high heat. Cook marinated pork in the hot pan, turning once, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
