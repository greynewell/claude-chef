## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground turkey
- ½ cup minced cilantro
- ½ cup dry bread crumbs
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 2  scallions, minced
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 slices fresh ginger, or more to taste
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 box toothpicks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine turkey, cilantro, bread crumbs, egg, scallions, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a large bowl. Gently mix with your hands until combined. Roll tablespoon-sized scoops between your palms to form meatballs. Arrange meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
