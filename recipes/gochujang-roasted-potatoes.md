## Ingredients

- 2  russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 ½ tablespoons grapeseed oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes  (Optional)
- 2  scallions, sliced
- ½  lime

## Instructions

1. Rinse potatoes in a colander to remove excess starch. Drain.
2. Place potatoes into a large microwave-safe bowl. Add 1 tablespoon oil and salt; toss to coat. Cover and microwave on high for 4 minutes. Stir, cover again, and microwave until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a colander to drain.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. Whisk gochujang, remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in the bowl used to cook the potatoes. Return potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat; spread onto the prepared baking sheet.
5. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring once or twice, until potatoes are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and garnish with scallions. Squeeze lime juice over top.
