## Ingredients

- ½ cup peanut butter
- 6 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 3 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2  red Thai chiles, seeded and finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 1 cup matchstick carrots
- 1  red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
- 4  green onions, thinly sliced
- 2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed and drained
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 (16 ounce) package pad Thai rice noodles
- 1 tablespoon chopped unsalted peanuts  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, Thai chiles, chile-garlic sauce, ginger, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. Set aside.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large wok or non-stick pan over high heat. Add chicken and stir constantly until almost cooked, about 3 minutes. Pour in 1/4 cup sauce mixture to chicken. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer chicken with its juices to a bowl.
3. Reduce heat to medium-high. Heat remaining tablespoon olive oil in the same wok or pan used for chicken. Add carrots; cook and stir until just softened but still crunchy, about 3 minutes. Stir in bell pepper; cook until softened, about 1 minute. Add reserved chicken with its juices, remaining sauce, green onions, bean sprouts, and cilantro. Cook and stir until just heated, about 1 minute. Keep warm.
4. Meanwhile place noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot water. Set aside until noodles are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.
5. Stir cooked noodles into vegetable mixture. Garnish with peanuts.
