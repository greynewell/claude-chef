## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 cups whole-grain bow-tie pasta
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ⅓ cup chopped celery
- ⅓ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ⅓ cup chopped carrot
- 1 ½ cups light Alfredo sauce (such as Classico® Light Creamy Alfredo)
- ½ cup light sour cream
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons snipped fresh dill
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (5 ounce) can solid white tuna (water pack), drained and broken into chunks
- ⅓ cup whole wheat panko bread crumbs
- 4 wedges lemon wedges  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 2-quart baking dish with nonstick spray.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, celery, bell pepper, and carrot; cook until vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.
4. Whisk together Alfredo sauce, sour cream, 2 tablespoons Parmesan, dill, and black pepper in a large bowl. Stir in cooked pasta, vegetables, and tuna until combined. Transfer to the prepared dish. In a small bowl, stir together panko and remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan; sprinkle over casserole. Lightly coat with nonstick spray.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until browned and bubbly, about 25 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.
