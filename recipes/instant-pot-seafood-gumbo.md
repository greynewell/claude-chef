## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 1  green bell pepper - stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour, divided
- 2 ¼ cups chicken broth, divided
- 6 ounces beer (such as Abita Turbodog®)
- 1 ⅓ cups water
- ¾ cup uncooked white rice
- ½ pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ⅓ pound cod, cut into 1-inch pieces

- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add butter, followed by celery, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook and stir until vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons flour over and stir to thoroughly coat.
2. Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth while continuing to stir vegetables. Pour in beer. Set an elevated trivet on top of the mixture. Pour water and rice into a small silicone bowl and set on top of trivet. Cancel Saute mode. Seal and lock the lid into place.
3. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.
5. Switch to Saute function. Remove rice and trivet carefully. Add shrimp, cod, scallops, Cajun seasoning, Worcestershire, salt, thyme, and cayenne to the Instant Pot®.
6. Whisk remaining flour with remaining chicken broth in a small bowl. Pour into the pot and mix together. Stir frequently and allow to thicken and cook until shrimp are bright pink, cod is easily flaked with a fork, and scallops are opaque, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with a scoop of rice.
