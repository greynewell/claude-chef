## Ingredients

- ½ pound uncooked pasta
- ¼ cup butter
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 3  garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
- 2 (8 ounce) cans chopped clams, drained with juices reserved
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- water

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent.
