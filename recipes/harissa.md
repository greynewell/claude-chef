## Ingredients

- 3 ½ ounces large dried red chili peppers
- 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more as desired
- 4 large cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
- 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- ½ teaspoon coriander seeds
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Break up chile peppers. Remove the stems and seeds and discard. Wear disposable gloves if working with medium-hot or hot peppers.
2. Place chile peppers in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let soak until softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well, then dab dry with paper towels.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over very low heat and cook garlic until soft but still pale, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then transfer to the food processor together along with chile peppers.
4. Toast caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and coriander seeds in the skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Crush them in a mortar and add to the food processor. Process while slowly adding remaining olive oil, scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed. Season with salt.
5. Spoon harissa into a sterilized glass jar and level the top. Add enough olive oil so the surface is covered and the harissa won't dry out. Seal and refrigerate.
