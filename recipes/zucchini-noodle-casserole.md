## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 5  zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler
- ¼ cup minced garlic
- 1 (16 ounce) jar marinara sauce, or to taste
- 1 (7 ounce) container 2% Greek yogurt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
