## Ingredients

- 3  beets, cut into quarters
- 1 small sweet onion, cut into quarters
- 1 head garlic, cloves peeled
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup vegetable broth
- 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 1 (16 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta
- 1 tablespoon shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste
- 1 pinch chopped fresh thyme, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine beets, onion, and garlic cloves in a bowl. Add olive oil, thyme, salt, and pepper; toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until cooked through and tender, about 1 hour.
4. Remove from the oven and let cool until beets can be handled, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beet skins.
5. Transfer mixture to a food processor. Add vegetable broth and lemon juice; pulse until smooth. Transfer to a saucepan.
6. Stir heavy cream into the beet mixture in the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until it begins to simmer, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese until melted. Set aside.
7. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Pour beet sauce over pasta and toss until well combined. Top with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and a pinch of additional thyme.
