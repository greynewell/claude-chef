## Ingredients

- 1 (18 ounce) loaf 1 16-20 oz round loaf artisan bread
- 1 cup Stella® Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, cubed
- ½ cup Stella® Fontinella Shredded Cheese
- ¼ cup Stella® Parmesan Shredded Cheese
- ¼ cup Stella® Asiago Shredded Cheese
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt
- 1 tablespoon dried Italian herbs
- 3 tablespoons parsley, chopped
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Slice the top of the bread loaf horizontally and vertically into 1-inch square sections, not slicing all the way through the loaf. Leave the bottom of the loaf intact with each section still attached.
3. Combine all Stella® cheeses in a large bowl. Mix in garlic salt, Italian herbs, and chopped parsley and ensure all ingredients are mixed well.
4. Gently stuff the cheese and herb mixture in between slices. Stuff between the vertical slices first, then go back to fill the spaces between the horizontal cuts.
5. Transfer the stuffed loaf to a baking sheet covered in foil. Pour melted butter evenly over the top. Wrap the loaf in foil and place in oven.
6. After 20 minutes, unwrap the foil from the top of the loaf. Continue baking for 10 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted and the top of the loaf is just crispy. Serve warm.
