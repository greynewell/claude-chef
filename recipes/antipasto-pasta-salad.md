- 1 pound seashell pasta
- ¼ pound Genoa salami, chopped

## Instructions

1. Make the antipasto salad: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shell pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain, run under cold water to cool pasta, and drain again.
2. Transfer drained pasta to a large bowl. Add Asiago cheese, salami, pepperoni, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives. Sprinkle dry dressing mix over top and stir until ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
3. Make the dressing: Whisk oil, vinegar, oregano, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Cover and set aside until ready to serve.
4. To serve, pour dressing over the chilled salad and mix until well combined.
