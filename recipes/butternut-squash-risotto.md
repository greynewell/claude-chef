## Ingredients

- 2 cups cubed butternut squash
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½  onion, minced
- 1 cup Arborio rice
- ⅓ cup dry white wine
- 5 cups hot chicken stock
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place squash cubes into a steamer basket in a saucepan with water. Cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Allow to steam until the squash is tender (10 to 15 minutes), then drain, and mash in a bowl with a fork.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir for 2 minutes until onion begins to soften, then stir in rice. Continue cooking and stirring until rice is glossy and the onion begins to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes more.
3. Pour in white wine; cook, stirring constantly, until it has evaporated. Stir in mashed squash and 1/3 of the hot chicken stock; reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir until chicken stock has been absorbed into rice, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of the remaining chicken stock, and continue stirring until it has been absorbed. Finally, pour in remaining stock, and continue stirring until the risotto is creamy.
4. Stir in Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper.
