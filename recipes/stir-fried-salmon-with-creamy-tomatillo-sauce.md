## Ingredients

- 4 medium tomatillos, husked, rinsed, and chopped
- 1 tablespoon sliced green onion
- 1 clove garlic, peeled
- ¼ teaspoon grated lime peel
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- ¾ teaspoon sugar, or to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup Lucerne Low-Fat Plain Yogurt (do not use nonfat), blended with
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 8 each low-fat flour tortillas
- 1 tablespoon Lucerne Sweet Cream Butter
- 1 pound salmon fillets, skinned and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
- 1 medium tomato, chopped and drained well
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 wedges Lime wedges
- ⅛ teaspoon Ground white pepper

## Instructions

1. In a blender or food processor, combine tomatillos, onion, garlic, lime peel, lime juice, sugar, and salt. Whirl until smooth. In a separate bowl, blend together the yogurt and cornstarch. By hand, stir the yogurt mixture into the tomatillo mixture just until combined; do not overbeat or sauce will separate. Set aside.
2. Brush tortillas lightly with hot water; then stack, wrap in foil, and heat in a 350 degrees F oven until warm (10 to 12 minutes).
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a wide nonstick frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add fish and stir-fry gently until just opaque but still moist in thickest part; cut to test (about 4 minutes). Remove from pan and keep warm. Wipe pan clean.
4. Add yogurt-tomatillo sauce to pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened (2 to 3 minutes); do not boil.
5. Divide sauce among 4 individual rimmed plates; spread sauce out evenly, then top equally with fish. Sprinkle with tomato and cilantro leaves, garnish with lime wedges, and season to taste with white pepper. Serve with tortillas.
