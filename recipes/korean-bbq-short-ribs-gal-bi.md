## Ingredients

- ¾ cup soy sauce
- ¾ cup water
- 3 tablespoons white vinegar
- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- ¼ cup minced garlic
- ½ large onion, minced
- 3 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick across bones)
