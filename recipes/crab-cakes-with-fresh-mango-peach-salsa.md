## Ingredients

- 2 medium mangos
- 2 large  peaches, peeled and pitted
- 2 medium Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- ½ cup chopped red onion
- 1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- ⅓ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 ½ tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 2 pounds lump crab, drained
- 3 stalks green onions, chopped
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups panko bread crumbs
- ¼ cup light olive oil

## Instructions

1. Score mango flesh and cut into chunks. Cut peaches into chunks. Transfer both into a bowl with tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, honey, and balsamic vinegar; stir carefully to combine, being careful not to bruise the fruit. Place in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the crab cakes, or up to 3 days.
2. Inspect crabmeat and discard any shells. Transfer meat to a bowl. Add green onions, salt, and pepper; gently mix to combine with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, making sure you don't break up the crabmeat.
3. Add eggs and flour; stir with a fork until combined. Shape mixture into eight 4- to 5-inch patties.
4. Place panko in a partially (not fully) sealed plastic bag. Roll over the crumbs with a rolling pin until crushed but not too fine; air will escape the bag through the opening. Transfer panko to a shallow bowl. Gently press crab cakes into the crumbs to coat on both sides, being careful not to break them.
5. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot, but not burning or smoking. Cook 4 crab cakes at a time in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil, then repeat with remaining crab cakes.
6. Serve on top of or alongside chilled salsa.
