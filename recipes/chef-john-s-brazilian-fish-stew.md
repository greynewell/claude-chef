## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- cayenne pepper to taste
- 1 (14 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1  red or yellow bell pepper, halved and thinly sliced
- 2  jalapeno peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
- ¼ cup chopped green onion
- 1 ½ pounds sea bass fillets, cut into chunks
- 1 pinch salt
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro leaves
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

## Instructions

1. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir just until onions start to get soft, 3 or 4 minutes. Add tomato paste, garlic, paprika, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Continue cooking about 3 minutes. Pour in coconut milk and add soy sauce. When mixture starts to bubble, let it simmer about 5 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium-high. Stir in bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, and green onions. Let mixture come back to a simmer. Transfer fish to skillet; stir. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until fish starts to flake, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Add salt, cilantro, and lime juice; stir carefully to avoid breaking up the fish. Serve with rice.
