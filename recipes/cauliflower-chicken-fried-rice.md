## Ingredients

- ¾ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 5  scallions, chopped, light and dark green parts separated
- 4  garlic cloves, minced
- 1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
- 2 pounds cauliflower rice
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 1 ½ cups frozen peas and carrots
- 2  eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Stir chicken, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, brown sugar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and cornstarch together in a large bowl.
2. Heat a wok or large saucepan over high heat. Swirl in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Spread chicken mixture in a single layer over the surface of the wok; cook for 1 minute. Flip and toss chicken. Spread out again; cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Transfer chicken to a plate.
