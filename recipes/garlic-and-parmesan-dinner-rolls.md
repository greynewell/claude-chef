- 1 teaspoon fine salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Mix yeast, 1/2 cup of flour, sugar, and warm water in a bowl.
2. Cover and let rest in a warm place until bubbling, about 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Stir in salt, olive oil, and egg.
4. Mix thoroughly and stir in remaining 1 3/4 cup flour to form a loose, sticky dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
5. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
6. Punch down and scrape the dough from the sides of the bowl.
7. Turn onto a lightly floured surface.
8. Sprinkle with more flour and shape into a rectangle.
9. Roll out to an approximately 10x12-inch rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick.
10. Brush with melted butter; sprinkle with garlic, Parmagiano-Reggiano cheese, black pepper, cayenne, and parsley.
11. Press flat one long edge of the rectangle and brush with water.
12. From the opposite end, roll evenly into a log.
13. Press the seam together to seal.
14. Cut into 8 rolls.
15. Transfer to a baking sheet, cut side up.
16. If necessary, cut an ‘X' in the top of each roll to expose filling.
17. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
18. Brush each roll with olive oil.
19. Sprinkle with more cheese.
20. Cover and let rise until slightly puffed, about 20 to 30 minutes.
