## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 pound bulk Italian sausage
- ½ cup diced onion
- 1 (26 ounce) jar pasta sauce (such as Kroger® Simple Truth Organic™ 4 Cheese)
- ½ cup chicken broth
- cooking spray
- 1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2  eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 4 medium zucchini, peeled
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Cook and stir ground beef and Italian sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Add onion and saute until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes.
4. Add pasta sauce and chicken broth.
5. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Spray a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray.
8. Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and basil together in a small bowl.
9. Cut zucchini lengthwise into thin strips (1/8 inch to 1/4 inch thick) with a thin, sharp knife.
10. Place a layer of tightly arranged zucchini slices in the prepared baking pan and spread a layer of the ricotta mixture on top.
11. Top with a small amount of the meat sauce followed by 1 to 2 ounces of mozzarella cheese.
12. Be sure not to overapply the sauce so you'll have enough for the very top of the dish.
13. Continue layering the lasagna with zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella.
14. Finish with a top layer of zucchini, the remaining meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.
15. Bake, uncovered, until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
16. Drain any excess liquid from the edges of the baking pan with a baster or ladle during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
17. Cut portions with a sharp knife first and then carefully remove with a large spatula to serve.
