## Ingredients

- 14 ounces dry brown lentils
- 2  carrots, grated
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  onions, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons water, or more as needed
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon yellow curry powder  (Optional)
- 4 cups cooked brown rice, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water; add lentils and bring to a rolling boil. Cook until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Add grated carrots; cook until slightly softened, about 10 minutes. Drain lentils and carrots.
2. Heat olive oil in the same pot over medium heat; add onions and garlic. Cook and stir until onions wilt and become transparent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lentils and carrots and reduce heat to medium-low. Add enough water to the pot to keep the lentil mixture from drying out.
