## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 8  green onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes in oil
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
- 1  lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 teaspoon hot Madras curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 ½ cups chopped raw shrimp
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 6 ounces phyllo pastry
- 4 large eggs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons salted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 4 tartlet pans with cooking spray.
2. Heat oil in a small pan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, lemon zest and juice, garlic, curry powder, coriander, and turmeric until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Increase the heat to medium, add shrimp, and mix until they turn pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cream and set aside.
3. Divide the phyllo dough into layers, about 1/16 inch thick. Spray each side with cooking spray, then use to line the prepared pans. Fill each with the shrimp mixture, then top with an egg and season with salt and pepper. Cover with another layer of sprayed phyllo dough. Brush tops with melted butter.
4. Cook in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 20 minutes.
