## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 ½ pounds lean boneless pork, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 ½ cups diced onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes
- 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chilies
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
- ¼ cup cold water
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat.
2. Spread flour into a wide, shallow dish; add pork and turn to coat, shaking off excess.
3. Cook coated pork in hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onion and garlic in with the pork; continue cooking and stirring until the onion softens, about 5 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes, green chilies, and 2 tablespoons cilantro over the pork mixture; stir. Place a cover on the Dutch oven and simmer the mixture until pork is tender and no longer pink in the center, about 40 minutes.
4. Whisk cold water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into the liquid in the Dutch oven and continue cooking until the sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Remove Dutch oven from heat; let dish rest 10 to 15 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese and desired amount of cilantro to serve.
