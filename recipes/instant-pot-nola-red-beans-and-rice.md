## Ingredients

- 1  green pepper, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- ½ medium onion, diced
- 2 teaspoons ground white pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground thyme
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon Cajun or Creole seasoning
- ½ teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add olive oil. Add bacon and pork neck bones to the hot oil. Cook until browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove meat and set aside. Add bell pepper, celery, and onion ("trinity" mix); cook and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Season with white pepper, thyme, garlic powder, oregano, cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning, and black pepper. Mix in garlic and continue cooking until onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Mix kidney beans, chicken broth, salt, and bay leaves into the vegetables in the pot; stir well to combine. Cancel Saute mode and return meat to the pot. Close and lock the lid. Set vent to "Sealing." Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Move valve to venting position and finish releasing pressure, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
4. Remove pork bones from pot. Use a fork to separate the meat from the bones and return meat back to the pot. Mix well. Serve with white rice.
