## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies, drained
- 2 cups shredded pepperjack cheese
- 4 cups oil for frying, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Crumble ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until evenly browned, then drain off grease. Add taco seasoning and cook according to package directions. Set aside.
2. Heat 1-inch-deep oil in a large skillet or preheat a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Lay out one egg roll wrapper at a time. Place a rounded tablespoon of seasoned ground beef in the center. Top with a small spoonful of green chilies and a little bit of shredded cheese. Roll up according to package instructions, and seal edges, wetting with water if necessary. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
4. Fry rolls in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from oil to drain on paper towels. Serve hot and fresh.
