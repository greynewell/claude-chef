## Ingredients

- 1  ground beef, or more to taste
- 1 small onion, chopped
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- ¼ cup beef broth
- 1  egg
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 3  potatoes, coarsely chopped
- ¼ cup baby carrots

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, onion, bread crumbs, broth, egg, Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, parsley, and garlic powder in a bowl using your hands. Form into a loaf. Center the loaf in the bottom of a slow cooker, leaving room on the sides.
2. Coat meatloaf with 1/4 cup ketchup and surround with potatoes and carrots. Cook on High, about 2 hours. Reduce heat setting to Low; cook until meatloaf is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 4 to 6 hours more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
