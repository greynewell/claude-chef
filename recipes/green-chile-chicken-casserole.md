## Ingredients

- 1  cooking spray
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cooked
- 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 (28 ounce) can tomatillos, drained
- 2 (4 ounce) cans mild chopped green chile peppers
- 1 bunch green onions, trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths
- ½ cup chopped cilantro
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 12  corn tortillas

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Chop cooked chicken thighs into small pieces and place in a medium mixing bowl. Stir 1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese and chili powder into the chicken.
3. Combine tomatillos, chile peppers, green onions, cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic in the bowl of a food processor. Process until pureed, about 3 minutes. Add chicken broth and pulse to mix. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Cut tortillas in half and place directly on the hot oven racks. Heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove tortillas and set aside.
5. Place 1 cup of the green sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer 1/2 of the tortillas over the sauce. Add 1/2 of the chicken mixture. Spoon 1/2 of the remaining green sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle on 1/2 of the remaining cheese. Repeat the layers of tortillas, chicken mixture, green sauce, and cheese.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbly, about 20 minutes.
