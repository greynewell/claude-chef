## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar

## Instructions

1. Crumble the ground beef into a stock pot or large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook stirring frequently until beef is evenly browned. Drain off excess grease.
2. Season with chili powder, oregano, cumin and hot sauce. Stir in the tomatoes and vinegar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 1 hour - or longer if you have time. Stir occasionally to prevent burning on the bottom.
