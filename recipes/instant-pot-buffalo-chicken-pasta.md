## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut in bite-sized pieces
- ½ medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 ½ cups chicken stock
- 1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed
- ⅓ cup Buffalo wing sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®), add butter, and select Saute function. Add chicken and onion to the melted butter and saute until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Hit Cancel. Remove chicken-onion mixture with a slotted spoon and set aside.
2. Add chicken stock to the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden or plastic spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in penne, salt, and garlic powder. Layer the following ingredients on top of the pasta, without stirring: cream cheese cubes, chicken-onion mixture, then Buffalo sauce.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow about 12 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Add mozzarella cheese to the pot. Stir until cream cheese and mozzarella have completely blended into the sauce. Let pasta sit in the pot until sauce has thickened, about 3 minutes.
6. Garnish servings with blue cheese.
