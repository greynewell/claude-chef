## Ingredients

- ½ cup chopped pecans
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- Coffee Cake:
- 1  serving nonstick cooking spray
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt
- ⅓ cup light sour cream
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup seedless raisins
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Stir together pecans, white sugar, and brown sugar for the pecan topping in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with cooking spray.
3. Combine brown sugar, applesauce, coconut oil, and butter for the coffee cake in a large bowl. Mix with a spatula until butter is almost completely mixed in, with some chunks remaining. Mix in yogurt, sour cream, and 1 teaspoon baking soda. Add all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, eggs, vanilla, baking powder, remaining 1 teaspoon baking soda, and salt; stir until batter is well mixed and a light brown color. Stir in raisins until evenly distributed in the batter; batter will be thick.
4. Scoop 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out evenly so it is flat. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the pecan topping. Repeat with remaining batter and pecan topping.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45 to 48 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Invert onto a cooling rack and then flip carefully so the sugary pecan-topped side remains on top. Serve warm.
