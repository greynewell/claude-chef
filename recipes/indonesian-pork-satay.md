## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic
- ½ cup chopped green onions
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger root
- 1 cup roasted, salted Spanish peanuts
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ½ cup soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons crushed coriander seed
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup melted butter

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, process garlic, green onions, ginger, peanuts, lemon juice, honey, soy sauce, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Puree until almost smooth. Pour in broth and butter, and mix again.
2. Place pork cubes in a large resealable plastic bag, and pour mixture over meat. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 hours, or overnight.
