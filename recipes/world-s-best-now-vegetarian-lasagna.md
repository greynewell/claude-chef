## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup minced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 8 ounces plant-based hot Italian-style sausage (such as Beyond Meat®), chopped
- 6 ounces cooked and crumbled ground meat substitute (such as BOCA)
- 1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon fennel seeds
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 12  lasagna noodles
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced
- 6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, 1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.
3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Meanwhile, stir together egg, ricotta, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a bowl.
5. To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.
6. Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake until hot and bubbly, about 25 minutes more. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into 12 equal servings.
