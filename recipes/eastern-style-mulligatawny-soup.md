## Ingredients

- water to cover
- 1 cup dried split peas
- 4 cups water, or more as needed
- ¾ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon ground dried chile pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon cumin seeds

## Instructions

1. Pour enough water over split peas in a large bowl to cover by at least 1 inch; soak at least 30 minutes.
2. Drain split peas and transfer to a large pot. Pour 4 cups water over the split peas. Stir turmeric, ground dried chile pepper, and salt into the water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, adding more water as needed to thin, until split peas are tender, 30 to 40 minutes.
3. Stir lemon juice and tomato paste into the split pea mixture; increase heat to medium and cook until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes more.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Fry garlic and cumin seeds in hot oil until the garlic browns, about 5 minutes; stir into the soup.
