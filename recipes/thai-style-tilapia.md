## Ingredients

- ½ cup coconut milk
- 6  whole almonds
- 2 tablespoons chopped white onion
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh lemon grass
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. In a food processor or blender, combine the coconut milk, almonds, onion, ginger, turmeric, lemon grass, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Process until smooth.
2. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper on both sides, then place them skin-side up in the skillet. Pour the pureed sauce over the fish. Use a spatula to coat the fish evenly with the sauce. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
