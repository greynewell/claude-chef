## Ingredients

- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container chicken stock
- 1 (3 pound) pork loin, or more to taste
- 3 tablespoons adobo seasoning
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon ground paprika
- 1 large white onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons chipotle paste
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 (14 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  limes, halved
- 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 cup fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Turn a large slow cooker to High. Pour chicken stock into the cooker and place pork loin in the center. Season pork with adobo, cumin, pepper, and paprika. Place onion, chipotle paste, and bay leaves in the stock around the pork. Place tomatoes and garlic on top of the pork, and squeeze limes directly over top, allowing pulp to fall into the slow cooker. Sprinkle with cinnamon and cloves.
2. Use a spoon to baste stock over the pork loin, then sprinkle entire surface evenly with cilantro.
3. Cover and cook on High until pork is slightly pink in the center, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Use a fork to shred pork.
