## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs, divided
- 3 tablespoons milk, divided
- 2 teaspoons butter, divided
- ¼ cup diced green bell pepper
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 2 (1/2 inch thick) slices processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), divided
- 4 (6 inch) flour tortillas

## Instructions

1. Beat 2 eggs with 1 1/2 tablespoons milk in a bowl.
2. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a 6-inch frying pan over medium heat. Add bell pepper and onion and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove 1/2 the mixture and set aside in a bowl.
3. Pour egg mixture and 1/2 vegetable mixture into the skillet. Tilt the pan, gently push one side of the egg, without breaking it, away from the side of the pan, and let the uncooked egg run onto the pan. Repeat with all four sides of the egg, cooking until bottom is set, about 2 minutes. Flip over and cook until bottom is slightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.
4. Slide omelet onto a tortilla, then slide tortilla back onto the pan. Place 1 slice of cheese onto the omelet and top with another tortilla. Cook until bottom is browned, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown opposite side, about 1 minute more. Slide quesadilla onto a plate and cut into 4 sections.
5. Beat remaining 2 eggs and 1 1/2 tablespoons milk together in a bowl. Grease the same pan with the second teaspoon of butter. Repeat steps 3-4 with the reserved vegetables and the remaining cheese and tortillas.
