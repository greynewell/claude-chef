## Instructions

1. Combine coriander seeds, fenugreek seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, and fennel seeds in a large skillet over low heat; toast until lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cloves, star anise, and cinnamon sticks; toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove seeds from cardamom pods and return to the skillet, discarding pods.
2. Transfer toasted spice mixture to a spice grinder or blender. Add turmeric, white peppercorns, black peppercorns, allspice, and nutmeg; grind into a fine curry powder.
3. Melt 3/4 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook until golden brown, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir in 4 tablespoons of the curry powder, Worcestershire sauce, and tomato paste. Remove from heat.
4. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large pot over low heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Increase heat to high; add 2 tablespoons curry powder, chicken, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and salt. Saute until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth and bouillon cubes; bring curry to a boil.
5. Stir carrots into the pot; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add potatoes; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in green bell peppers and apples. Cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Stir in curry paste and simmer until sauce thickens and flavors combine, about 5 minutes.
