Drizzle each with 1 tablespoon olive oil, sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce and sprinkle generously with Creole seasoning. Squeeze a lemon wedge over each pile and add the rind to the mixture. Sprinkle with black pepper.
5. Wrap each piece of foil into a tightly sealed pouch. Place on the grill. Cover. Allow to cook and steam for 15 to 18 minutes until the shrimp and potatoes are cooked through.
