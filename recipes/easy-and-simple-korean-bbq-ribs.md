## Ingredients

- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3  green onions, chopped
- 2 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 2 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick across bones)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together the soy sauce and sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved, and stir in the black pepper, garlic, green onions, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.
2. Place the ribs in a large bowl, and pour the marinade over the ribs. Stir to coat the ribs with the marinade, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Stir the ribs and marinade again, and refrigerate for 1 more hour.
