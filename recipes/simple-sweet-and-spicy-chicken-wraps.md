## Ingredients

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup finely chopped seedless cucumber
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
- 1 cup thick and chunky salsa
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves

## Instructions

1. Make the sauce: Mix mayonnaise, cucumber, honey, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
2. Make the wraps: Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. Add chicken strips; cook and stir until they start to turn golden and are no longer pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. Stir in salsa, honey, and cayenne pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
3. Stack tortillas, 4 at a time, in a microwave oven and heat until warm and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds per batch.
4. Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise-cucumber sauce, top with a layer of spinach, and arrange about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture on top.
5. Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches, and start rolling from the right side. When wrap is halfway rolled, fold the top of the tortilla down, enclosing the filling, and continue rolling to make a tight, compact cylinder.
