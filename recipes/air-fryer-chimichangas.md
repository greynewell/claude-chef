## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ½ cup diced onion
- 2 cups shredded cooked chicken
- ½ (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened
- 1 (4 ounce) can hot fire-roasted diced green chiles (such as Ortega®)
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 1 ½ tablespoons chicken taco seasoning mix (such as McCormick®)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, or to taste
- avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Heat oil in a medium skillet. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add chicken, Neufchâtel cheese, green chiles, chicken broth, taco seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until mixture is well combined and Neufchâtel has been evenly incorporated.
3. Heat tortillas in a large skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 1/3 cup chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla and top with a heaping tablespoon of Mexican cheese. Fold the top and bottom of tortillas over the filling, then roll each into a burrito shape. Mist with cooking spray and place in the basket of an air fryer.
4. Air-fry for 4 to 6 minutes. Flip each chimichanga over, mist with cooking spray, and air-fry until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes more.
