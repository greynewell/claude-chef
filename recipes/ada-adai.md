## Ingredients

- 1 cup split Bengal gram (chana dal)
- 1 cup skinned split black lentils (urad dal)
- ½ cup split yellow lentils (moong dal)
- 1 cup rice
- salt to taste
- 2  dried red chile peppers, or to taste
- water, as needed
- 2 tablespoons cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil

## Instructions

1. Place the chana dal, urad dal, moong dal, and rice into a large bowl and cover with several inches of cool water; allow to soak 8 hours to overnight.
2. Grind the soaked dal and rice with the salt and red chile peppers into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Add enough water to the mixture to make a batter just thin enough to spread. Stir the cumin seeds into the batter.
3. Heat a griddle (or a tawa) over medium heat. Gently grease the griddle with oil on the edges and the middle. Ladle the batter on the tawa and spread into a thin circle using the back of the ladle or a large spoon. Cook for a few minutes and flip over to the other side. Cook a few more minutes, transfer to a plate, and serve immediately. Adas are best eaten hot off the griddle.
