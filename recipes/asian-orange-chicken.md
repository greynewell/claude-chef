## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups water
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ⅓ cup rice vinegar
- 2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon grated orange zest
- 1 cup packed brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onion
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining sauce.
3. Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.
4. Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
5. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.
6. Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
7. Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
