## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 1 pound ground chicken
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as RO*TEL®), halfway drained
- ½ (1.25 ounce) package reduced-sodium taco seasoning mix
- 1 (10 ounce) can mild enchilada sauce, divided
- 5 ounces crumbled queso fresco, divided
- ¼ cup Mexican crema
- 1 tablespoon Mexican crema
- 1  egg
- 6 each corn tortillas
- 3 ounces grated Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add ground chicken, stirring and breaking into crumbles until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour diced tomatoes with chiles and their liquid into the skillet and add taco seasoning. Stir to incorporate.
3. Combine 8 ounces enchilada sauce, 4 ounces queso fresco, Mexican crema, and egg in a bowl.
4. Pour remaining enchilada sauce into the bottom of an 8x6-inch glass casserole dish. Trim tortillas to have a straight edge if desired. Lay two tortillas in the enchilada sauce in the dish. Place some chicken mixture on top and ladle some enchilada sauce mixture over. Repeat layers. Top with remaining queso fresco and Cheddar cheese.
5. Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 minutes more. Let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
