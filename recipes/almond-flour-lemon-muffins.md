## Ingredients

- 3 cups almond flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- ½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
- ¼ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- ½ cup almond flour
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 tablespoon half-and-half
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 10 muffin cups with paper liners.
2. Sift almond flour, baking powder, and baking soda together into a bowl and set aside.
3. Mix sugar, eggs, Greek yogurt, butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add flour mixture into the wet ingredients and mix until well combined, but be careful not to overmix. Distribute the batter evenly between the prepared muffin cups, filling the cups all the way to the top.
4. Make the topping by mixing almond flour, brown sugar, and butter together until crumbly. Set aside.
5. Bake muffins in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and sprinkle crumble mixture over the tops. Continue baking until the edges are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the muffins comes out clean, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
6. While the muffins are cooling, mix powdered sugar, half-and-half, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the glaze. Remove the muffins from the pan and drizzle the glaze over the top.
