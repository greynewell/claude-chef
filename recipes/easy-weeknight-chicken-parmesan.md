## Ingredients

- 8 ounces uncooked spaghetti
- ⅓ cup Progresso® Italian style panko crispy bread crumbs
- ⅓ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- 4 each boneless skinless chicken breasts, flattened slightly
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 (18 ounce) can Progresso™ Recipe Starters™ fire roasted tomato cooking sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a large zip-top bag. Shake each chicken breast in the bag to coat; transfer to a plate.
2. Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until browned, 6 to 10 minutes, turning once. Pour tomato cooking sauce around chicken, then sprinkle remaining bread crumb mixture and mozzarella cheese over top; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to medium, and cook until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
3. While the chicken is cooking, cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
4. Serve chicken and sauce over spaghetti.
