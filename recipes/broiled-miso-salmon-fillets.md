## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoons miso paste
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1 tablespoon oil, or as needed
- 1 pound salmon fillets

## Instructions

1. Toast sesame seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Watch them closely and remove from heat once sesame seeds are a golden brown. Set aside.
2. Combine miso paste, mirin, soy sauce, ginger, and honey in a small bowl. Mix well. Stir in toasted sesame seeds.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking pan with foil and lightly grease with oil.
4. Coat salmon well in the miso sauce and place skin-side up on the baking pan.
5. Broil in the preheated oven, watching closely, until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
