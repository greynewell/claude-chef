## Ingredients

- 3 cups water
- 2 cups sushi rice
- 1 teaspoon salt  (Optional)
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 1  carrot, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- ½ pound sushi-grade ahi tuna, sliced
- ½ pound sushi-grade salmon, sliced
- 1 pound cooked shrimp
- 1 medium cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- 1  avocado, diced
- ½ cup diced mushrooms
- 1 bunch green onions, diced
- ¼ cup diced pickled ginger

## Instructions

1. Combine rice, water, and salt in a pot. Bring to a low boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, mix rice vinegar and sugar together until sugar is dissolved.
3. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Pour in eggs and cook until set, about 5 minutes. Let cool briefly before dicing. Cook carrot in the same skillet over low heat until softened slightly, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove rice from heat and let stand for at least 5 minutes.
5. Transfer rice to a large bowl. Add vinegar-sugar mixture while using a fan or hair dryer to blow air over the rice. Mix, without crushing the rice grains, until all of the vinegar is absorbed and rice is sticky and shiny, 3 to 5 minutes.
6. Arrange tuna, salmon, and shrimp over rice. Garnish with egg, carrot, cucumber, avocado, mushrooms, green onions, and pickled ginger.
