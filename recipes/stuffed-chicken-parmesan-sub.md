## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 2 cups Italian-style salad dressing
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1  egg
- 3 cups Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons butter, divided, or as needed
- 10 slices prosciutto, chopped into chunks
- 4 cups marinara sauce
- canola oil as needed
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste
- 4  Italian sub rolls
- 8 slices provolone cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Slice each chicken breast down the center to make 4 cutlets. Place each between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2 inch thinness with a meat mallet.
2. Marinate chicken breasts in Italian dressing in the refrigerator overnight.
3. Remove chicken to bring to room temperature 1 hour before cooking.
4. Combine flour and baking powder in one bowl, milk and egg in another bowl, and bread crumbs in a third bowl. Set aside.
5. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a pan over medium heat. Cook prosciutto in the hot butter until it starts to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
6. Bring marinara sauce to a simmer in a saucepan.
7. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
8. Lay chicken cutlets out flat. Line 1/4 of mozzarella cheese down the center of each and sprinkle 1/4 of prosciutto over cheese. Fold cutlets in half over the stuffing and secure edges together with toothpicks.
9. Dunk rolled chicken into the flour mixture, then egg mixture, and finally bread crumbs.
10. Drop chicken into the preheated fryer and cook until crumbs are golden brown, chicken floats, and is no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to let grease run off.
11. Cut sub rolls down the centers and spread remaining butter into interiors. Assemble sandwiches in the following manner: bottom sub half, chicken cutlet, marinara, provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese, and top sub half. Transfer subs to a baking pan.
12. Toast in the preheated oven until bread is crisp and cheeses are melted, about 2 minutes. Serve hot.
