## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked brown rice
- 4 cups water
- 4 (1 ounce) envelopes taco seasoning mix
- 4 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
- 1 (10 ounce) container salsa
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 16 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup shredded reduced-fat Monterey Jack cheese
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Combine rice, water, and taco seasoning in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool; it will be soggy.
2. Combine black beans, pinto beans, corn, salsa, onion, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; toss to mix. Mix in cooked rice, Cheddar, and Monterey Jack.
3. Divide the bean-rice mixture evenly among the tortillas and roll up.
4. Spray a cookie sheet lightly with cooking spray. Lay tortillas in a single layer on the cookie sheet and place in the freezer until fully frozen, about 2 hours. Wrap each tortilla in plastic wrap or foil and place in a large zip-top bag to store in the freezer until ready to use.
