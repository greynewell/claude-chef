## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 large red onion, chopped
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2  leeks, chopped
- 1 small carrot, chopped
- 1 pound beef round steak, sliced paper thin

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, garlic, and red onion. Stir in the black pepper, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds, leeks and carrot. Mix in the meat by hand to ensure even coating. Cover and let marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
