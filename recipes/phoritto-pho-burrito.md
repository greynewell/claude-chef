## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 ½  onion, thinly sliced
- 3  jalapeno peppers, thinly sliced
- 2 (14 ounce) cans beef-flavored pho broth
- 1 pound frozen ribeye steak, thinly sliced
- 10 ounces thin rice noodles (vermicelli-style)
- 8  burrito-size flour tortillas
- 1 (8 ounce) jar chili-garlic sauce
- 1 (8 ounce) package bean sprouts
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, or to taste
- 1 bunch Thai basil
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 1  lime, sliced

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add jalapenos; cook and stir until dark green, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. Heat broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook batches of ribeye slices in hot broth until medium-rare, 10 to 20 seconds per batch.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; cook at a boil until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain.
4. Place tortillas on a microwave-safe plate. Heat in the microwave until warm, 20 to 25 seconds.
5. Divide onion and jalapeno mixture, ribeye slices, noodles, chili-garlic sauce, bean sprouts, hoisin sauce, Thai basil, and cilantro among warmed tortillas. Spoon a small amount of broth on top. Fold opposing edges of tortillas over filling and roll up into burritos. Serve with lime slices.
