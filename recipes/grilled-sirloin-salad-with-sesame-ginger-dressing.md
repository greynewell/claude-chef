## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns, crushed
- 1 (12 ounce) sirloin steak, trimmed
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 16  scallions, white part only
- 1  red bell pepper, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 cup curly endive (frisee)
- 1 cup chopped radicchio

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Blend soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger together in a blender or food processor until dressing is smooth.
3. Press peppercorns into both sides of steak and season with salt.
4. Place steak, scallions, and red bell pepper on the preheated grill and cook for 4 minutes. Flip and cook until vegetables are charred and steak is cooked to desired doneness, about 4 minutes more.
