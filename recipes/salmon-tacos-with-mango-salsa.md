## Ingredients

- 3  mangoes, diced
- 2  peaches, diced
- 3  poblano peppers, seeded and diced
- ½  red onion, diced, or more to taste
- ½  lime, juiced, or more to taste
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 24 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- cooking spray
- 2 pounds fresh salmon
- 1 small head cabbage, shredded
- 3  avocados, sliced
- 2  limes, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Combine mangoes, peaches, poblano peppers, red onion, juice of 1/2 a lime, and 1/2 the cilantro in a large bowl to make mango salsa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.
2. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise, ketchup, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl to make special sauce.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange tortillas on a baking sheet.
4. Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat; coat with cooking spray. Cook salmon until easily flaked with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and flake into smaller pieces with a fork.
5. Heat tortillas in the preheated oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
6. Divide salmon among tortillas. Top with mango salsa, special sauce, shredded cabbage, avocados, and remaining cilantro. Wrap up tacos and serve lime wedges alongside.
