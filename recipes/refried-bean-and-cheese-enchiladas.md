## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 (16 ounce) cans refried beans
- 2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 12  small corn tortillas
- 2 (10 ounce) cans red enchilada sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Mix refried beans, 1 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend, and onion in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.
3. Stack tortillas, 3 at a time, on a microwave-safe plate; heat in microwave until warmed, about 30 seconds. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
