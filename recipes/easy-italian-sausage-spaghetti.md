## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 pounds sweet Italian sausage
- 1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 (28 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- 2  tomatoes, diced
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried basil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage, mushrooms, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in hot oil until sausage is browned and crumbly, about 20 minutes; drain and discard grease.
