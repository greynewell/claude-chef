## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- ¼ cup chopped green onions
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard accumulated liquid.
2. Cut tofu into 2x4-inch strips about 1/4-inch-thick.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook tofu strips in hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Stack tofu strips horizontally in a dish with sloping sides, like a teacup saucer.
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet. Add green onions; cook and stir until fragrant and sizzling, 10 to 20 seconds. Spoon green onions over tofu while still sizzling. Coat with soy sauce. Let sit until tofu soaks up flavors, 3 to 5 minutes.
