## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 1 (7 pound) bone-in pork shoulder roast
- ¼ cup water
- ½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring  (Optional)
- 2 cups barbecue sauce

## Instructions

1. Mix paprika, brown sugar, chili powder, cumin, salt, black pepper, oregano, sugar, white pepper, and cayenne together in a small bowl.
2. Massage spice rub into the pork roast. Wrap tightly in a double layer of plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
3. Unwrap the roast and place in the bottom of a lined slow cooker. Add water and liquid smoke. Cover and cook on Low until pork is fork-tender, 8 to 10 hours.
