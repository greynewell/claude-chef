## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 2 cups canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained with liquid reserved
- ½ cup tahini
- 1  egg
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup whole wheat flour, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Place a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
2. Combine 1 teaspoon cumin, paprika, chili powder, and coriander together in a small bowl.
3. Blend chickpeas, tahini, egg, 2 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, salt, and pepper together in a food processor or blender, adding liquid from canned chickpeas if needed, until very smooth. Transfer chickpeas mixture to a bowl; fold in whole wheat flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until batter drops easily from a large spoon.
4. Drop a little water onto the skillet; if it dances on the surface, the skillet is ready. Add about 1 teaspoon olive oil to skillet. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, forming 3- to 4-inch circles, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet and keep warm in the preheated oven. Repeat with remaining batter, greasing pan as needed with remaining olive oil.
5. Sprinkle pancakes with cumin mixture and salt.
