## Ingredients

- 1 bunch chopped fresh cilantro
- 6 tablespoons pine nuts
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste
- ⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 (12 ounce) package dry tagliatelle or wide fettucine pasta
- 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Place the cilantro, pine nuts, lemon juice, feta cheese, salt, and black pepper into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse several times to mince the ingredients.
2. Drizzle in 1/2 cup of olive oil with the machine running, and process until the pesto is a slightly textured paste.
3. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
4. Once the water is boiling, stir in the tagliatelle pasta, and return to a boil.
5. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
6. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
7. Place the cooked pasta into a large serving bowl, and toss with the pesto.
8. Drizzle a bit of extra-virgin olive oil over the pasta, and serve hot.
