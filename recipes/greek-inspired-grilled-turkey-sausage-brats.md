## Ingredients

- 4 medium turkey bratwurst sausage links (such as Jennie-O®)
- ⅓ cup diced red onion
- ⅓ cup chopped cucumber
- ⅓ cup diced tomatoes, drained
- 12 large Kalamata olives, quartered
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ¾ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 medium brat buns
- ⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place sausages on the rack, and grill until sausages are cooked through, 10 to 16 minutes, turning occasionally. Your cooking time will depend on your grill and how close the sausages are to the heat. Check periodically with a meat thermometer until you reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), which is well done.
3. Combine red onion, cucumber, tomatoes, and Kalamata olives in a small bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice, and stir in the oregano, salt, and pepper.
4. Place the turkey sausages in the buns. Evenly distribute the Greek-style veggie mixture over the sausages, sprinkle with some feta cheese, and serve.
