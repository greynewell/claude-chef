## Ingredients

- 1 large head cauliflower, coarsely chopped
- 2 medium white onions, halved and thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 large potato, with skin, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 (32 fluid ounce) container vegetable stock
- 2 tablespoons sliced almonds

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Place cauliflower and onions on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper; mix to coat.
3. Place in the preheated oven and roast until cauliflower is browned and cooked, but not too soft, about 25 minutes.
4. While cauliflower is roasting, melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in potato and turmeric. Add stock and increase heat to medium; bring to a simmer. Cover and cook until potato is soft, about 10 minutes.
5. Remove cauliflower and onions from the oven. Place 1 cup cauliflower in a bowl and set aside. Add remaining cauliflower and onions to the soup. Return soup to a simmer and cook until flavors have melded, about 5 minutes.
6. While soup is simmering, place almonds in a dry skillet over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Adjust seasoning as needed. Ladle into bowls, add reserved cauliflower, and top with toasted almonds.
