## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, crushed or to taste
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 4 (6 ounce) mahi mahi fillets
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Mix honey, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, ginger, and garlic together in a shallow dish. Season fish fillets with salt and pepper; place them skin-sides down in the dish with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove fish fillets, reserving marinade. Fry fish for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, turning only once, until fish flakes easily with a fork. Remove fillets to a serving platter and keep warm.
3. Pour reserved marinade into the skillet; simmer over medium heat until reduced to a glaze. Spoon glaze over fish and serve.
