## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 bulb fennel - thinly sliced, fronds lightly chopped, stems discarded
- 1  onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (4.5 ounce) cans sardines packed in oil
- ⅓ cup raisins
- ¼ cup pine nuts
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add fennel bulb, fronds, and onion. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add sardines with oil; stir until crumbled. Stir in raisins, pine nuts, basil, fennel seeds, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes; cook until toasted. Pour in tomatoes. Let sauce simmer.
