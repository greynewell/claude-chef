## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup warm water
- 1 extra large onion, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and lightly mashed
- ¼ bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying
- 11  eggs

## Instructions

1. Mix the flour, cornstarch, salt, baking powder, 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and water together in a bowl to form a dough; cover and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
2. Divide the dough into 11 portions, and form into balls.
3. Roll each dough ball out on a floured surface to a 5-inch circle.
4. Cook the onion in 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat until browned, about 10 minutes; stir in the garbanzo beans, cilantro, cumin, coriander, salt, and black pepper until thoroughly combined.
5. Heat 2 cups of vegetable oil in a deep-sided skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Break an egg into a greased custard cup, cover with a square of waxed paper, and cook in a microwave oven on High setting for 40 seconds.
7. Place about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the garbanzo bean filling onto a dough circle, place the slightly cooked egg onto the filling, and gently fold the dough into a half-moon shape.
8. Fold the dough edge over and crimp with a fork to seal in the filling.
9. Deep fry the sambusaks, one or two at a time, in the hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
10. Remove with a wire strainer, and drain on paper towels.
