## Ingredients

- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons relish
- 1 teaspoon spicy mustard
- ½ teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon minced cilantro
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
- ½ medium onion
- ½ small red bell pepper, chopped

- 2 cups fresh bread crumbs
- 1 ½ cups crabmeat
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)

## Instructions

1. Mix mayonnaise, relish, mustard, hot sauce, garam masala, and cilantro for tartar sauce in a bowl until well blended. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until flavors have blended, about 1 hour.
