## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked long grain brown rice
- 2 ½ cups water
- 1  avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 2  vine-ripened tomatoes, diced
- 1 ½ cups diced English cucumbers
- ⅓ cup diced red onion
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- ¼ cup sliced Kalamata olives
- ¼ cup chopped fresh mint
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Bring brown rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool, fluffing occasionally with a fork.
2. Toss avocado and lemon juice together in a large bowl. Add tomatoes, cucumber, feta, onion, olives, mint, olive oil, lemon zest, garlic, salt, and pepper to the bowl; lightly toss the mixture until evenly combined.
3. Fold cooled rice gently into the mixture. Serve immediately or chill up to 1 hour; the salad does not last well for more than a day as the tomato and cucumber begin to release their juices and the salad becomes watery.
