## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry fusilli pasta
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 6  chicken tenderloins, cut into chunks
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- salt and pepper to taste
- garlic powder to taste
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. Stir in fusilli pasta, cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, and mixed vegetables. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
4. Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and butter together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the casserole.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 30 minutes.
