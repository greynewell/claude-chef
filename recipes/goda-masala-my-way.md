## Ingredients

- ¾ cup shredded coconut
- ¼ cup white sesame seeds
- 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided
- 2 large bay leaves
- 5 each dried red chile peppers
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- ¾ cup coriander seeds
- 1 (2 inch) cinnamon stick, broken into pieces
- 1 teaspoon whole cloves
- ½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns

## Instructions

1. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Toast the coconut, stirring constantly, until brown and fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add sesame seeds to skillet and toast, stirring constantly, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add to the coconut.
2. Warm 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in the same skillet; add bay leaves and toast, flipping halfway, until browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and add to the bowl of coconut. Add another 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil; toast chiles until browned, about 3 minutes. Remove immediately and add to the bowl.
3. Add 1/2 teaspoon of oil to the skillet and toast cumin seeds until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add to the bowl. Repeat with coriander seeds. Break cinnamon stick into pieces and toast in the last 1/2 teaspoon of oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to the bowl. Repeat with cloves and black peppercorns.
4. Let toasted spices cool completely, at least 20 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and grind until fine. Add turmeric and stir to combine. Keep spice mix in an airtight container, in a dark cool cabinet, for up to 6 months.
