## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- ¼ cup butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ½ cup heavy cream  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes or until al dente; drain.
2. While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Slice any scallops over 3/4-inch thick in half so they'll cook evenly; stir scallops, basil, and parsley into the skillet. Cook and gently stir just until scallops feel slightly firm when pressed with a finger, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scallops will become tough and chewy if overcooked.
3. Reduce heat to low; stir in lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour in cream if you like a thicker sauce and cook just until the sauce begins to simmer.
4. Ladle scallops and sauce over hot pasta and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.
