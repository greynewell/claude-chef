## Ingredients

- 3 pounds flank steak
- ⅓ cup white vinegar
- ½ cup soy sauce
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  limes, juiced
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1  white onion, chopped
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1  lime, juiced
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 2  jalapeno peppers, chopped
- 1  white onion, quartered
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled
- 4  dried New Mexico chile pods
- 1 pinch salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (32 ounce) package corn tortillas
- 2 cups grated cotija cheese  (Optional)
- 2  limes, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Lay flank steak in a large glass baking dish.
2. Make the marinade: Whisk soy sauce, oil, vinegar, 4 cloves of garlic, juice of two limes, salt, black pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, cumin, and paprika together in a bowl until well blended; pour over steak, turning to coat both sides. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 8 hours.
3. Make the relish: Stir onion, cilantro, and lime juice together in a small bowl. Set aside.
4. Make the salsa: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chile pods and toast for a few minutes; transfer pods to a bowl of water and soak for 30 minutes.
5. Place tomatoes, 1 onion, 4 cloves of garlic, and jalapeños onto a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until vegetables are toasted, about 20 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a blender or food processor. Add soaked chiles, salt, and pepper; puree until smooth.
6. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Cut the marinated flank steak into cubes or strips.
7. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak; cook and stir until cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated.
8. Warm tortillas in a dry skillet over low heat for about a minute on each side.
9. Place some steak on each tortilla; top with relish and prepared salsa. Sprinkle with cotija cheese. Garnish with lime wedges and serve.
