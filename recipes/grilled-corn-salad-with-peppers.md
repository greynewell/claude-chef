## Ingredients

- 5 ears corn, husked
- ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 medium red bell pepper, chopped
- ½ medium poblano pepper, diced
- 2 stalks green onions, thinly sliced
- ½ cup finely chopped cilantro
- 2 tablespoons lime juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place corn on the preheated grill and cook, turning often, until roasted and charred all over, about 10 minutes.
3. While corn is grilling, heat a small, dry skillet over high heat. Add cumin seeds and shake constantly until dark and aromatic, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and crush in a mortar and pestle; set aside.
4. Remove corn from the grill and let cool. Cut off kernels with a knife and discard cobs.
5. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 of the corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, until corn has toasty brown bits on it, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
6. Add remaining oil and corn to the skillet with garlic, crushed cumin, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, then add to the first batch of corn.
7. Add bell pepper, poblano pepper, green onions, cilantro, and lime juice. Mix everything together and let sit until flavors have blended, about 15 minutes.
