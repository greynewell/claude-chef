## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- ¾ cup apple-grape-cherry juice
- ⅔ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup peach-flavored bourbon liqueur (such as Southern Comfort ®)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- ¾ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ cup apple-grape-cherry juice
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, heavy pan. Cook and stir chicken pieces in hot oil until lightly golden on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl and set aside.
2. Whisk together water, brown sugar, 3/4 cup fruit juice, soy sauce, ketchup, bourbon liqueur, vinegar, garlic, onion, red pepper flakes, and ginger in the Dutch oven. Bring sauce to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
3. Stir chicken into sauce, then bring to a full boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until sauce is reduced and thickened and chicken pieces are no longer pink in the middle, about 20 minutes.
4. Remove chicken pieces to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Stir together 1/4 cup fruit juice with cornstarch in a small bowl until smooth; whisk into sauce, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer; cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Return chicken pieces to sauce and stir to combine.
