## Ingredients

- 2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- kosher salt to taste
- 1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained (reserve liquid) and rinsed
- ¼ cup finely chopped roasted cashews
- ¼ cup seasoned rice vinegar (such as Nakano®)
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground paprika
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 drizzle sesame oil (optional)
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.
2. Distribute carrots and garlic cloves on the baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons sesame oil and season with kosher salt; toss to coat.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until carrots are tender, stirring halfway through, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow carrots to cool to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes..
4. Add the carrot-garlic mixture, garbanzo beans, cashews, rice vinegar, lime juice, tahini, ginger, Sriracha, paprika, and salt to a food processor; blend until well combined. Stream in the reserved bean liquid though the feed tube, one tablespoon at a time, until hummus is smooth and creamy and has reached desired consistency.
5. Taste, and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Transfer to a bowl, and garnish with a drizzle of sesame oil and chopped cilantro.
