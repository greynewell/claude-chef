## Ingredients

- 2 cups uncooked white rice
- 4 cups water
- 4 (5 ounce) salmon fillets
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 tablespoons orange juice
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat.
2. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.

4. Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat.
5. Place salmon fillets into the skillet and cook until golden, about 3 minutes on each side.
6. Cover and reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until the salmon flakes easily with a fork, 2 to 3 minutes longer.
7. Remove salmon from the skillet and set aside.
8. Stir orange juice and soy sauce into the same skillet.
9. Cook on high heat until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.
10. Remove from heat and stir in the sesame oil.
