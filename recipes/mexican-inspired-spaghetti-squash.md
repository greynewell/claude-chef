## Ingredients

- 1  spaghetti squash
- ½ teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½  sweet yellow onion, chopped
- ½  yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- nonstick cooking spray
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- ¾ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
- ¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  Roma tomatoes, chopped
- 1  avocado, diced, or more to taste
- 1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil.
2. Cut squash in 1/2 lengthwise. Remove and discard seeds. Add a few drops of oil to each 1/2 and spread using a pastry brush. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Place cut-side down in the prepared baking pan.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion, bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
5. Remove cooked squash from the oven and reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 2-quart casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
6. Remove strands from squash using a fork or spoon and place them into a large bowl. Add black beans, sauteed veggies, 1/2 cup Mexican cheese, cilantro, cumin, salt, and pepper; mix well. Spoon mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Mexican cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with tomatoes, avocado, and olives. Serve immediately.
