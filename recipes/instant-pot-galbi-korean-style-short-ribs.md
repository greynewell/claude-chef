## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef short ribs
- 1  Asian pear - peeled, cored, and coarsely chopped
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- ½ tablespoon peeled and coarsely chopped fresh ginger
- 1 cup low-sodium soy sauce, divided
- ¼ cup rice wine
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  carrots, peeled and cut in chunks
- 5  radishes, peeled and cut into chunks
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ bunch green onions, chopped, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak ribs in a large bowl of water for 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, combine Asian pear, onion, garlic, and ginger in a blender or food processor; purée until smooth. Transfer mixture to a mixing bowl. Mix in 3/4 cup soy sauce, rice wine, water, brown sugar, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and pepper to create a sauce. Set aside.
3. Drain ribs and dry them well. Trim off excess fat. Place ribs in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot), then add carrots and radishes. Pour Asian pear sauce on top. Close and lock the lid. Select Meat function according to manufacturer's instructions; set the timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Transfer meat and vegetables to a plate and set aside.
5. Select the Sauté function on your Instant Pot. Stir in white sugar, remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce, and remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sugar has melted and sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes. Return ribs and vegetables to the pot; stir to coat with sauce.
6. Garnish ribs and vegetables with green onions and sesame seeds.
