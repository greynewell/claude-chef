## Ingredients

- 24 (3 inch) frozen tart shells, thawed
- 6 slices bacon, or more to taste
- 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese  (Optional)
- 2  green onions, diced
- 4  eggs
- 1 ¼ cups milk
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup shredded Swiss cheese, or as needed  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange tart shells in 2 muffin tins; line shell each with a layer of pie weights or dried beans.
2. Bake shells in the preheated oven until edges of crusts are lightly browned and about 75% cooked, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble when cooled.
4. Divide 1 cup Swiss cheese, bacon, and green onions evenly into the tart shells.
5. Whisk eggs, milk, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Ladle egg mixture into each tart shell about 2/3 full. Top each tart with the remaining 1/4 cup Swiss cheese.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until egg is set in the middle of each tart and shells are browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
