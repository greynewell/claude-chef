## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
- 1 ½ cups cubed fresh mozzarella cheese
- 2  fresh plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into bite-size pieces
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the orzo, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain well, and let cool.
