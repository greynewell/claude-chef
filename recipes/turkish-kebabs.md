## Ingredients

- 2 large onions, chopped
- 2  garlic cloves, crushed
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 pinch curry powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced
- 8 ounces sour cream
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- 6  pita bread rounds

## Instructions

1. Place the chopped onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent. Stir in 2 crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well; add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
2. Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, dill, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Mix well; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
3. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
4. Remove the meat from the marinade mixture, brushing off extra onions. Spread the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping, and salt to taste. Broil about 3 minutes per side or until browned and crispy, turning halfway through cooking.
5. Divide the cooked meat between the pita breads, and drizzle with tzatziki sauce to serve.
