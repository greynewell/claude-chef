## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons ketchup
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 (6 ounce) thick-cut boneless pork loin chops

## Instructions

1. Whisk honey, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ketchup, ginger, onion powder, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag; add chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, turning occasionally, for 4 to 8 hours. Refrigerate remaining marinade in the bowl.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
3. Remove pork chops from marinade and shake off excess. Discard the marinade from the plastic bag. Grill chops on the preheated grill, basting with some of the reserved marinade until meat is browned, no longer pink inside, and shows good grill marks, 8 to 10 minutes per side. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
4. Pour remaining reserved marinade into a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook marinade until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly; serve sauce with chops.
