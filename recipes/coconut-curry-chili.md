## Ingredients

- ½ pound ground turkey
- 2 (10.75 ounce) cans  tomato soup
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic

- ¼ cup mango chutney

## Instructions

1. Break the ground turkey into small pieces into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the turkey, continuing to break it into smaller pieces, until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease as possible from the turkey.
