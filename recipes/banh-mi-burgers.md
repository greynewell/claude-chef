## Ingredients

- ½ cup chopped cucumber, seeded if large
- ¼ cup thinly sliced green onion
- ¼ cup chopped carrot
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 pounds ground pork
- 2 tablespoons tamari sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese rice wine)
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 6  sesame seed hamburger buns
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix together the cucumber, green onion, carrot, rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of mirin, and sugar until the mixture is well blended. Refrigerate 3 hours to overnight.
2. Place the pork in a mixing bowl, and lightly combine with tamari sauce, sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of mirin, ginger, chili garlic sauce, and fish sauce. Divide the meat into 6 equal parts, and form each part into a patty. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
4. Grill the burgers until the meat is no longer pink inside and the outside is crisp and brown, about 5 minutes per side. To assemble, place a burger on a sesame seed bun, and pile about 1/4 cup of the pickle mixture onto the burger. Sprinkle with a bit of fresh basil and mint, if desired.
