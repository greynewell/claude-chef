## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry garbanzo beans
- ½  yellow onion, diced
- ½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 4 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Place garbanzo beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 12 to 24 hours. Drain.
2. Blend garbanzo beans, onion, parsley, garlic, flour, lemon juice, salt, cumin, coriander, baking soda, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary, until mixture is finely ground and holds together when pressed. Transfer garbanzo mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until flavors blend, 1 to 2 hours.
3. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Divide dough into 12 portions and roll each with moistened hands into a ball.
5. Working in batches, cook falafel balls in hot oil until browned and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
