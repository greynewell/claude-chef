## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup chopped prosciutto
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons chopped oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1 ½ pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1/2 inch strips
- ½ cup chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the prosciutto, sage, parsley, sun-dried tomatoes, and onion 5 minutes, until onion is tender. Mix the pork strips into the skillet, and brown about 10 minutes, turning once.
