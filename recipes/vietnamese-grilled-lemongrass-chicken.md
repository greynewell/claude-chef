## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped lemongrass
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon fish sauce
- 1 ½ pounds chicken thighs, or more to taste, pounded to an even thickness

## Instructions

1. Mix together canola oil, lemongrass, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and fish sauce in a glass bowl until sugar is dissolved; add chicken and turn to coat in marinade.
2. Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour.
3. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken thighs from marinade; shake to remove excess. Discard remaining marinade.
