## Ingredients

- 2 large eggplant
- 3 tablespoons tahini
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ¾ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Using a fork, poke holes in the eggplant so steam will be able to release during cooking.
2. Place eggplant on the preheated grill. Grill until skins are charred, about 30 minutes, turning occasionally. Transfer to a baking pan, cover, and let steam for 10 minutes.
3. Using your hands, carefully remove the stem and the skin; the skin should be split open and peel off easily. Discard the skin and place flesh in a colander; let drain for 20 minutes. Press out any remaining moisture with paper towels.
4. Place eggplant in a food processor. Add tahini, lemon juice, garlic, salt, smoked paprika, and cumin. Pulse until smooth. Add parsley and olive oil and pulse until oil is incorporated.
