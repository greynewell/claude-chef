## Instructions

1. Mix 2 tablespoons olive oil and harissa paste together in a small bowl.
2. Place chicken thighs in a large glass bowl and add harissa mixture.

4. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours to overnight.
5. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
6. Add chicken, skin-side down.
7. Cook until skin is browned, about 5 minutes, then flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
8. Remove to a plate and set aside.
9. Reduce heat to medium and add onion, poblano pepper, and serrano pepper to the pan, with another tablespoon oil if needed.
10. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
11. Cook and stir until veggies are slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes.

16. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes.
