## Ingredients

- ½ cup pineapple or other tropical fruit preserves
- ¼ cup hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 4 (6 ounce) tuna steaks, about 1 inch thick

## Instructions

1. To prepare marinade, combine preserves, hoisin, lime juice, cilantro, ginger, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Stir well.
2. Pour into a resealable plastic bag or glass bowl; toss tuna with marinade to coat. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
4. Remove tuna steaks from marinade, shake off excess, and discard remaining marinade. Cook on preheated grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side. Be careful not to overcook - the tuna should be lightly browned on the outside but still slightly pink in the middle. Serve immediately.
