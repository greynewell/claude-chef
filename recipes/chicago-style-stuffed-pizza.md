## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, divided
- ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- ½ cup yellow cornmeal
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ pound spicy Italian sausage - browned, drained and crumbled
- 9 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ⅓ cup diced pepperoni
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ⅛ cup chopped green bell pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- ½ cup tomato sauce

## Instructions

1. To Make Dough: In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in 1 cup warm water; in a separate small bowl combine the yeast, 1/2 cup flour, and 1/2 cup warm water. Mix together and let rest in bowl for about 20 minutes, until foamy.
2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl mix together remaining 2 1/2 cups flour with cornmeal and salt; remove half of this mixture from bowl and stir 1 cup sugar water into bowl. When well mixed, return second half of flour/cornmeal mixture to bowl and mix all together; then stir in yeast mixture. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 12 minutes. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume.
3. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). To Make Stuffing: In a large bowl combine the sausage, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, pepperoni, onion, bell pepper, oregano and garlic. Mix well.
4. Press half of the dough in the bottom and up the sides of a lightly greased deep dish pan. Bake crust in preheated oven for 4 minutes, then add the stuffing mixture to the bottom crust and cover with top crust; seal edges together with fingers, and trim excess. Slit top crust to allow steam to vent during baking; top with tomato sauce.
5. Bake on lower rack at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 45 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes, then cut and serve.
