## Ingredients

- ½ pound ground beef
- 1 large zucchini, ends trimmed
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- ½ (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Transfer beef into a large mixing bowl.
3. Slice zucchini in half lengthwise, then use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick shell all around zucchini. Chop scooped-out zucchini flesh and add to beef in the mixing bowl.
4. Stir spaghetti sauce, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, black olives, and garlic into beef-zucchini mixture until well combined. Lightly stuff both halves of zucchini with filling. Place filled zucchini halves into a baking dish; cover tightly with foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven; turn on the broiler and adjust an oven rack to within 6 inches of the broiler's heat source.
6. Uncover the baking dish; sprinkle 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese over each zucchini half. Broil until cheese is browned and bubbling, about 5 minutes.
