## Ingredients

- 4 medium fresh poblano peppers
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 thin slices  shredded Cheddar cheese
- slice shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 (15 ounce) can enchilada sauce (such as Hatch®)
- aluminum foil
- ¼ cup grated Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Turn a gas stove burner to high. Hold poblano peppers directly on the flame with a pair of tongs and turn until skins are charred. Let peppers cool. Leaving peppers as close to whole as possible, remove skins, seeds, membranes, and stems.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix in chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Place peppers in a nonstick casserole dish. Insert a slice of Cheddar cheese and a slice of Monterey Jack cheese into each pepper. Spoon some ground beef mixture into each pepper. Place the remaining beef on top of the peppers, and cover with enchilada sauce. Cover with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the peppers. Bake until peppers are bubbly and fragrant, another 45 minutes.
