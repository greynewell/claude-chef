## Ingredients

- ½ cup rice vinegar
- ½ cup water
- 2 tablespoons raw cane sugar
- 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
- 1 small cucumber, thinly sliced
- ½ small red onion, sliced into petals
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- ⅔ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 3  green onions, chopped
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon sriracha sauce
- 1 teaspoon garlic puree
- 1 teaspoon ginger paste
- 6  sesame seed burger buns

## Instructions

1. Bring rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sriracha to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Place cucumber and red onion in a flat-bottomed dish and pour vinegar mixture over the top. Set aside to pickle as you prepare the bulgogi.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard grease; return beef to skillet. Add soy sauce, brown sugar, green onions, sesame oil, sriracha, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce begins to thicken, about 8 minutes.
3. Serve bulgogi mixture on hamburger buns topped with the pickled cucumbers and onions.
