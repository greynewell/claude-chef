## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 5 cups chicken broth, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small yellow onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
- ¼ teaspoon dried marjoram
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Rinse quinoa twice and drain well.
2. Pour chicken broth into a saucepan; bring to a boil.
3. Melt butter in a separate saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion and garlic until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir quinoa into onion mixture; cook, stirring frequently, until quinoa is toasted and coated in oil, about 3 minutes.
4. Slowly pour wine over quinoa mixture; cook and stir until wine is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Ladle 1/2 cup chicken broth over quinoa mixture; cook, stirring frequently, until absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue ladling broth, 1/2 cup at a time, over quinoa mixture; cook, stirring frequently, until quinoa is tender and has burst, about 20 minutes. You may not use all the chicken broth.
5. Mix Parmesan cheese and cream into quinoa mixture; season with marjoram, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add a splash of chicken broth to make quinoa more creamy, if desired.
