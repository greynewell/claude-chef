## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 8  toothpicks
- 4  reduced-fat mozzarella string cheese sticks, halved
- 1  egg
- ¾ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs

## Instructions

1. Preheat a toaster oven on broil setting, or set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spray a small baking sheet with cooking spray.
2. Insert toothpick vertically into each cheese stick half to mid-way point. Beat egg in a small bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate small bowl.
