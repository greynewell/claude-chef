## Ingredients

- 1  lime, juiced
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro
- 1  jalapeno pepper, diced
- 1 tablespoon ground ancho chile powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ pound halibut fillets
- 8  corn tortillas
- 2 cups shredded cabbage
- 1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
- 1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese
- 1  avocado, sliced

## Instructions

1. Stir lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, jalapeno, chile powder, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl or resealable zip-top bag. Add halibut and marinate for 20 to 25 minutes. Do not over-marinate, as lime juice will start to 'cook' the fish.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain marinade; grill fillets for 5 minutes. Turn and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 2 minutes more.
3. Warm tortillas on the grill or stove. Divide halibut among tortillas and top with cabbage, salsa, pepper Jack cheese, and avocado.
