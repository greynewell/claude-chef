## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package dry penne pasta
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 pound mild Italian sausage
- 1 cup chopped onion
- ½ cup white wine
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with garlic
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
2. Heat oil in a large, deep skillet. Add sausage and onion; cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toss with cooked penne, and place in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Sprinkle top with mozzarella.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
