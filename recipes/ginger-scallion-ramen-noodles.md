## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles, without flavor packets
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- ¾ cup thinly sliced scallions
- ¼ cup shredded carrots

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, chicken broth, rice vinegar, cornstarch, ginger, honey, and garlic together in a small bowl; set aside.
2. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking water.
3. Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add scallions and carrots to the hot skillet and quickly stir-fry until soft, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in sauce, and cook until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes. Stir in drained ramen noodles, separating and tossing them with tongs until coated. Add reserved cooking water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency.
