## Ingredients

- 3 medium crookneck yellow squash, cubed
- ¼ pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) box chickpea pasta shells (such as Banza®)
- 3 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives
- 2 tablespoons chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- 3 tablespoons sherry vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Combine squash and green beans in a salad bowl. Drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil on top; season with smoked paprika, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Toss until evenly coated and spread out on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring halfway, until tender and starting to brown, about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add chickpea pasta. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.
5. Drain pasta and transfer to the salad bowl. Gently mix in roasted vegetables, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and oregano. Whisk remaining olive oil and sherry vinegar together in a small bowl. Pour over salad and toss gently until combined.
