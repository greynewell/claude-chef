## Ingredients

- 2 cups vegetable or canola oil
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- 10 (6 inch) corn tortillas (cut 2 into 1/2-inch strips)
- 1 small mango, cut into small dice
- ½  Granny Smith apple, unpeeled, cut into small dice
- 4 large strawberries, hulled and cut into small dice
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh mint
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons orange marmalade
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 1 pint peach sorbet
- 1 pint raspberry sherbet
- 1 pint vanilla ice cream

## Instructions

1. In a 10-inch skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat to 370 degrees or until a tortilla strip dropped in sizzles vigorously. Mix sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. Using tongs, slide one tortilla into the oil. Fry, turning once, until it stops sizzling and turns golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove and set on paper towels lining a large wire rack set over a shallow pan. Sprinkle liberally with cinnamon sugar. Repeat with one tortilla at a time, then the tortilla strips. (Can be stored in foil or a large tin overnight.)
2. Up to 4 hours ahead, mix next 7 ingredients for salsa; refrigerate until ready to serve.
3. Put 3 small scoops of sorbet or ice cream on each tortilla. Top with fruit, garnish with tortilla strips and serve immediately.
