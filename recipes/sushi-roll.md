## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup uncooked short-grain white rice
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 4 sheets nori seaweed sheets
- ½  cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips
- 2 tablespoons pickled ginger
- 1  avocado
- ½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
2. Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
3. Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.
4. Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.
5. Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.
6. Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
7. Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.
