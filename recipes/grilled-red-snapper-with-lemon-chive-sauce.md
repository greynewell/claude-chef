## Ingredients

- 1 (2 pound) whole red snapper, cleaned and scaled
- 5  lemons, juiced, divided
- ¼ cup sweet soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger
- 3  tomatoes, chopped
- 1 bunch chives, chopped
- ½  red chile pepper, sliced
- 1 pinch white sugar, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
