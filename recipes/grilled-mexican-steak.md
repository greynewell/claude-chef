## Ingredients

- ½ cup cumin seeds
- 5  jalapeno peppers, seeds and ribs removed, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper
- ⅓ cup fresh lime juice
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ cups olive oil
- 2 bunches cilantro (leaves and stems)

## Instructions

2. In a blender, combine the cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, pepper, lime juice, and salt. Pulse the blender to finely chop ingredients. Add the oil and cilantro and puree until smooth.
