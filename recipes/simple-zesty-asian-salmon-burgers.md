## Ingredients

- 2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon
- ½  red bell pepper, minced
- ¼ cup minced sweet onion
- ¾ cup bread crumbs
- 2  eggs, slightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha hot sauce
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon dried mustard powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Place a colander on top of a bowl; add salmon to the colander and separate fish a bit to allow it to drain. Let stand until well drained, about 10 minutes. Discard juice and transfer salmon to a large bowl.
2. Mix bell pepper and onion into the salmon. Add bread crumbs, eggs, soy sauce, Sriracha, ginger, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, mustard powder, and garlic powder; mix to combine. Form into 5 patties. Place patties on a cookie sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight.
3. Heat vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Gently place burgers into the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook, turning just once, until well browned, 7 to 9 minutes per side. Place cooked burgers on a serving platter.
