## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup old-fashioned oats
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup low-fat vanilla Greek yogurt
- ⅓ cup buttermilk
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ¾ cup peeled and grated apple
- ¾ cup peeled and grated carrots
- ⅓ cup chopped walnuts, lightly toasted

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.
2. Stir together flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Whisk together yogurt, buttermilk, oil, egg, and vanilla extract in a second bowl. Fold flour mixture into yogurt mixture, mixing just until combined and flour disappears. Stir together apple, carrot, and walnuts in a separate bowl; gently fold into the batter. Divide batter evenly among the muffin cups.
3. Bake muffins in the preheated oven until golden brown or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 17 to 19 minutes.
4. Cool muffins in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
