## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 (12 ounce) package Hillshire Farm® Rope Smoked Sausage, cut into 1/2" coins

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add sausage; cook about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.
