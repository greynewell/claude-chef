## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ½ pounds small new red potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 8 ounces thin French-style green beans, trimmed
- 1 ½ teaspoons coarse-ground Dijon mustard
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 (6 ounce) cod fillets
- 3 tablespoons prepared black olive tapenade
- 6  lemon wedges, or to taste
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, halved
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line an extra-large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Coat parchment with cooking spray.
2. Toss potatoes in a bowl with 1 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes.
3. Toss green beans in bowl with remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil, mustard, remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Push potatoes to one side of the baking sheet. Lay beans and fish separately on the other side. Spread 3/4 tablespoon tapenade on each fillet.
4. Bake until cod is no longer translucent and flakes easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes. If vegetables need more time, transfer cod to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Roast vegetables 5 to 10 minutes more.
5. Serve with lemon wedges, tomatoes, and parsley.
