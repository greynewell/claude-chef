## Ingredients

- 5 pounds beef knuckle, with meat
- 2 pounds beef oxtail
- 1  white (daikon) radish, sliced
- 2  onions, chopped
- 2 ounces whole star anise pods
- ½  cinnamon stick
- 2  whole cloves
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1 slice fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 ½ pounds dried flat rice noodles
- ½ pound frozen beef sirloin
- Sriracha hot pepper sauce
- hoisin sauce
- thinly sliced onion
- chopped fresh cilantro
- bean sprouts (mung beans)
- sweet Thai basil
- thinly sliced green onion
- limes, quartered

## Instructions

1. Place the beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot. Season with salt, and fill pot with 2 gallons of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 2 hours.
2. Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Put onions and unpeeled ginger on a foil-lined, 10x15-inch roasting pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until onion and ginger are charred, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Chop onions. Peel and slice ginger.
3. Skim fat from surface of broth, and add oxtail, daikon, and charred onions. Tie anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, peppercorns and charred ginger in a square of cheesecloth; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 tsp. salt. Simmer over medium-low heat at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Strain broth. Discard spices and bones. Reserve meat from bones for other uses, if desired. Taste broth and add additional salt as needed. Chill overnight.
4. Skim fat from top of chilled broth. Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.
5. Cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions until soft, but not mushy. Cut sirloin into paper-thin slices.
6. Divide noodles among bowls (1 1/2 cups per bowl). Top each with a few raw sirloin slices. Ladle boiling broth into bowls to cook beef and cover noodles.
