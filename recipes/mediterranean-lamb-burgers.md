## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground lamb
- ½ pound ground beef
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (16 ounce) container Greek yogurt
- ½  lemon, zested
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 large sweet onion, cut into 1/2-inch slices
- 4 slices  green tomato
- 4  ciabatta sandwich rolls, sliced horizontally
- 1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese, sliced
- 8  baby arugula leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
2. Make the patties: Mix ground lamb, ground beef, mint, ginger, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until just combined. Divide evenly into four portions and shape into large patties. Set aside.
3. Make the sauce: Mix Greek yogurt, lemon zest, garlic, and salt in a bowl; cover and refrigerate.
4. Cook burger patties on the preheated grill until cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 4 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
5. While burgers are cooking, get ready to assemble: Place slices of onion and green tomato on the grill. Cook until lightly charred, about 1 minute on each side.
6. Spread yogurt sauce over sliced ciabatta rolls. Continue assembly by placing each burger patty on a roll. Divide feta cheese slices over the patties. Top each with a slice of grilled tomato, grilled onion, and 2 leaves of arugula, followed by the top half of the roll.
