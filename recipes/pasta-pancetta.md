## Ingredients

- 5  shallots, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 6 ounces pancetta bacon, diced
- 2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
- 2 pinches freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pinches dried oregano
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 (12 ounce) package linguine pasta
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, transfer back to the pot, and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pancetta in hot oil until just beginning to brown. Stir in shallots, mushrooms, garlic, pepper, and oregano; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Strain liquid from the pan into pasta; toss to coat. Divide pasta onto individual serving plates, then top with equal portions of pancetta and mushrooms. Serve with Parmesan cheese and pepper.
