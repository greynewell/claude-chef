## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½  onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch pieces
- ½ cup chicken broth
- 1 (15 ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, undrained
- 1 (6 ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained and cut into quarters
- 1 (4 ounce) can sliced olives, drained
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil for 1 minute. Add chicken; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes.
