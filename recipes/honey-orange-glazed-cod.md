## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ¾ pound cod fillets
- 2 tablespoons orange marmalade
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ½ tablespoon orange juice
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Coat a broiler pan with cooking spray and place cod fillets on top.
2. Mix marmalade, honey, orange juice, Dijon mustard, sesame oil, soy sauce, and pepper in a small bowl until well combined.
3. Broil cod in the preheated oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Brush 1/2 of the honey-orange glaze on top; continue to broil until fish flakes easily with a fork, 4 to 5 minutes more. Adjust timing depending on the thickness of the fillets.
4. Brush fillets with remaining glaze. Garnish with parsley.
