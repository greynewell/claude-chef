## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 large lemon, zested and juiced
- 2 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup cream
- 4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add garlic and saute until soft, about 1 minutes. Add chicken broth and lemon juice; bring to a boil.
3. Add shrimp and cook only until it turns pink; do not fully cook at this point. Remove shrimp from the sauce and set aside; cover to keep warm.
4. Reduce the skillet temperature to medium. Add Parmesan cheese, cream, and lemon zest to the sauce; bring to a simmer. Cook to thicken the sauce, about 2 minutes. Season with salt.
5. Add shrimp to the sauce just before it has fully thickened and cook until bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 1 to 2 minutes; don't overcook.
6. Combine shrimp sauce, pasta, and cilantro; toss and serve.
