## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup creamy, low-salt peanut butter
- 1 cup hot water, divided
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon red curry paste, or more to taste
- ¼ cup canola oil, divided
- 1 ½ pounds boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic, or more to taste
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 large carrot, cut into thick strips
- ½ cup halved green beans
- ½ cup sliced zucchini
- 1 small onion, sliced
- ½  sweet red pepper, thinly sliced
- 3  scallions, sliced
- ½ cup unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts, divided
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1  lime, cut into wedges
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk peanut butter, 1/3 cup hot water, brown sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and curry paste together in a bowl. Set peanut sauce aside.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a deep skillet or large wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken, ginger, and garlic. Saute, stirring constantly, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
3. Pour 2/3 cup hot water into skillet. Add broccoli, carrot, and green beans. Cover and steam for 2 minutes. Remove vegetables from skillet and reserve steaming liquid in a bowl.
4. Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet. Add zucchini, onion, and red pepper; stir-fry for 4 minutes. Return steamed broccoli, carrots, and green beans to the skillet. Add remaining oil, if needed. Continue cooking until vegetables are tender but still crisp, 3 to 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to medium-low.
5. Return cooked chicken to skillet. Add peanut sauce, scallions, 1/3 cup peanuts, and 1/3 cup cilantro. Stir thoroughly and heat through, 1 to 3 minutes. Add reserved steaming liquid to thin sauce, if necessary.
6. Garnish with lime wedge and remaining peanuts and cilantro. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes.
