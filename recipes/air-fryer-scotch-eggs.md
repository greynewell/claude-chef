## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons Greek yogurt
- 2 tablespoons mango chutney (such as Patak's®)
- 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon curry powder
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 1 pound pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)
- 6  eggs, hard-boiled and shelled
- ⅓ cup flour
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Make the dipping sauce: Combine yogurt, chutney, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, curry powder, and cayenne in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use.
2. Make the Scotch eggs: Divide pork sausage into 6 even portions. Flatten each portion into a thin patty. Place 1 hard-boiled egg in the middle of each patty and wrap sausage around eggs, sealing all sides. Set aside.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Place flour in a small bowl, beaten eggs in another small bowl, and panko on a plate. Dip each sausage-wrapped egg into flour, then dip into beaten egg, letting the excess drip off. Roll in panko and place on a plate.
5. Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Arrange eggs in the basket in a single layer without overcrowding; cook in batches if necessary. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 12 minutes, turning eggs over halfway through. Repeat with remaining eggs. Serve with dipping sauce.
