## Ingredients

- 3  potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1  sweet onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup Romano cheese, grated
- 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.
3. Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water.
4. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.
5. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
6. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, and set aside.
7. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
8. Cook and stir the onion and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
9. Set the onion and garlic aside.
10. In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, black pepper, onion and garlic mixture, eggs, chicken broth, and Romano cheese until thoroughly combined.
11. In a second bowl, mix the mashed potatoes and ricotta cheese.
12. Spoon half the meat mixture into the prepared baking dish, and smooth into an even layer with a spoon.
13. Spread the mashed potato mixture over the meat, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the meat; sprinkle 1 cup  mozzarella cheese over the mashed potato layer.
14. Cover the cheese with the remaining meat mixture in an even layer; press the edges down to seal in the mashed potatoes.
15. Sprinkle loaf with additional 2 tablespoons of mozzarella cheese, if desired.
16. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaf is browned and the meat is no longer pink, about 1 hour.
17. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
18. Let the loaf stand for 10 minutes before serving.
