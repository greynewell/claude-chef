## Ingredients

- 4  lamb shanks
- ½ cup cider vinegar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon tamarind concentrate
- 1 ½ tablespoons garam masala
- 1  onion, chopped
- 8 cloves garlic, peeled
- ⅓ cup sliced fresh ginger
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- ½ cup water
- 1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
- 1 large onion, chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 4 teaspoons brown sugar
- ½ cup fresh cilantro, for garnish  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place lamb shanks in a large resealable plastic bag. Whisk together cider vinegar, oil, salt, tamarind concentrate, and garam masala in a bowl, and pour into the bag. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a foil-lined baking sheet.
3. Remove marinated lamb shanks and place on the prepared baking sheet. Season all sides with salt. Roast in the preheated oven until well-browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve marinade in the bag.
4. Combine 1 onion, garlic, ginger, cherry tomatoes, and water in a blender and pulse on and off until smooth. Set aside.
5. Combine cayenne pepper, paprika, cinnamon, cumin, dried mustard, and black pepper in a small bowl.
6. Melt clarified butter in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir 1 onion until softened and well-browned, about 30 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in cayenne pepper mixture. Cook and stir until spices are aromatic, about 2 minutes.
7. Pour marinade from the bag into the stockpot, and stir in tomato-onion mixture and brown sugar. Bring mixture to a simmer. Place lamb shanks in the pan and reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, turning occasionally, until meat is tender and easily pierced with a fork, 3 to 4 hours.
8. Remove lamb from the pot and cover with foil. Increase heat and simmer the sauce for a few minutes, skimming the fat from the top. Taste and add salt if needed. Serve lamb shanks with sauce spooned over the top. Garnish with cilantro.
