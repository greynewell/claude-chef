## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- ⅛ teaspoon dashi granules
- 1 ¾ cups chilled water
- 2  egg yolks
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying
- 1  sweet potato, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch slices
- 1  onion, sliced into half-rings
- 1  bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup fresh green beans, trimmed
- ¾ cup shiitake mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Whisk light soy sauce, mirin, and dashi granules together in a bowl for the sauce; set aside.
2. Whisk water and egg yolks together in a bowl until well combined. Sift in flour and whisk until just combined; batter will be a bit lumpy.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or a deep saucepan until very hot, but not smoking.
4. Dip sweet potato, onion, bell pepper, green beans, and shiitake mushrooms one by one into the batter and transfer immediately into the hot oil. Deep-fry tempura in batches, making sure to not overcrowd the wok, until batter is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from oil and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Repeat until all vegetables have been used. Serve hot with dipping sauce.
