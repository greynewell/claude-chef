## Ingredients

- ¾ cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup chopped fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley
- ½ medium white onion, chopped
- 2 medium lemons, juiced, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) fresh salmon fillet
- 1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
- 1 ½ cups milk
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- 1 (1.6 oz) package Sauce, CPC, KNORR Alfredo Sauce, dry mix
- 1 cup chopped fresh asparagus
- 1 clove garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Combine wine, olive oil, parsley, onion, and juice of 1 lemon in a large skillet over medium heat until simmering. Place salmon on top, with scales down. Cover and poach until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and cover to keep warm.
3. Combine milk, butter, and sauce mix in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk constantly until boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, about 4 minutes.
4. Fill a small skillet with 1/4 inch water, remaining lemon juice, and garlic; bring to a boil. Add asparagus, cover, and steam, checking frequently to avoid overcooking, until bright green and tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Flake poached salmon and add to warm pasta. Add sauce and asparagus; toss to combine.
