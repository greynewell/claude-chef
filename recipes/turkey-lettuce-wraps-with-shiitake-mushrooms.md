## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 2 ounces mai fun (angel hair) rice noodles
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 4  shiitake mushrooms, sliced
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 (16 ounce) package ground turkey
- 6  green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped water chestnuts
- 4 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger root
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
- 12 leaves green leaf lettuce
- ½ cup bean sprouts
- 1  carrot, grated
- ½ cup salted peanuts
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ½ cup sweet chili sauce

## Instructions

1. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off heat; stir in rice noodles. Cover, and allow noodles to soak until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Rinse with cold water. Drain well.
2. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the mushrooms in the hot oil until they are browned and softened, about 2 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the pan. Reserve.
3. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in the pan. Cook and stir the turkey in the oil until it is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the green onions, water chestnuts, ginger, and garlic; continue to cook for 1 minute. Mix in the reserved mushrooms, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Simmer briefly to combine the flavors. Take the pan off the heat; stir in the rice vinegar, sesame oil, and orange zest.
4. To assemble lettuce wraps, place a bit of turkey filling on each lettuce leaf. Top each with cooked noodles, and a sprinkle of bean sprouts, carrots, peanuts, and cilantro. Serve with sweet chili sauce for dipping.
