## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon  (Optional)
- 4 ears fresh sweet corn, kernels cut from the cob
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 small onion, chopped
- ½ small red bell pepper, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- ¼ cup beer
- ¼ cup crumbled cotija cheese
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, chop bacon and set aside.
2. Place corn kernels into a large skillet over high heat; sprinkle cumin, sea salt, and cayenne pepper over corn. Turn corn over with a spatula as it cooks, then stir in onion, red bell pepper, and garlic. Stir corn mixture every few minutes, until it begins to stick in the pan.
3. Pour beer into the pan to help unstick corn; cook and stir until corn develops very dark spots and onion and red bell pepper are soft, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle with chopped bacon, cotija cheese, and cilantro.
