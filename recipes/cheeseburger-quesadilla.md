## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon butter
- ½ small yellow onion, chopped
- 2 pounds ground beef
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- cooking spray
- 8 (8 inch) flour tortillas
- 2 cups shredded Colby cheese
- 4 teaspoons ketchup, or to taste
- 4 teaspoons yellow mustard, or to taste
- 4 teaspoons sweet relish, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until slightly tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain liquid from beef, and let sit for 2 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.
3. Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese, 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. Flatten the quesadilla with your hand.
4. Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut quesadilla into 4 pieces. Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard, and relish.
