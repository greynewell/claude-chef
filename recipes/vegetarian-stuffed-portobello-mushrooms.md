## Ingredients

- ½ cup water
- ⅛ cup dry
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
- 8  baby portobello mushrooms, stemmed
- ½ cup finely diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, finely diced
- ¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided
- ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese
- ⅛ cup shredded Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon dried parsley
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring water and lentils to a boil in a large saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
3. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms in the hot oil until softened and liquid starts to cook out, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and place into a baking dish, cap-side down.
4. Heat remaining oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until onion is transparent and garlic fragrant, about 5 minutes.
5. Combine lentils, onion-garlic mixture, 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, feta cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Stir until well mixed.
6. Fill mushroom caps evenly with mixture and top with remaining Cheddar cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve.
