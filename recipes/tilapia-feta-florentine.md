## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 (9 ounce) bags fresh spinach
- ¼ cup sliced kalamata olives
- 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
- ½ teaspoon grated lemon rind
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ⅛ teaspoon white pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is soft, about 5 minutes.
