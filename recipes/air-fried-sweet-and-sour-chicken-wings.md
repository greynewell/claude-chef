## Ingredients

- 2 pounds party chicken wings
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup white sugar
- ⅔ cup distilled white vinegar
- ⅓ cup water
- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon ketchup

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place wings in a large bowl. Drizzle oil over the top, sprinkle with salt, and stir until evenly combined. Place 1/2 of the wings in the air fryer basket, skin side down.
3. Air fry wings for 10 minutes. Flip wings over using tongs and cook for 10 minutes more. Increase temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Flip wings over and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes more. Repeat with remaining wings.
4. Meanwhile, combine sugar, vinegar, water, soy sauce, cornstarch, and ketchup in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk until sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn heat off and let cool slightly.
5. Place wings in a large bowl. Pour sauce over the top, toss to coat, and serve immediately.
