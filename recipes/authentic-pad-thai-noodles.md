3. Cook and stir tofu in the wok, turning the pieces until they are golden on all sides.
4. Remove tofu with a slotted spoon and drain on plate lined with paper towels.

9. Pour reserved peanut oil in the small bowl back into the wok.
10. Toss garlic and drained noodles in wok until they are coated with oil.
