## Ingredients

- ¼ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup water
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ cup pearl (Israeli) couscous
- ¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- ¼ cup sliced Kalamata olives
- 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese
- 1 cup canned garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Pour the chicken broth and water into a saucepan, stir in the garlic, and bring to a boil. Stir in the couscous, cover the pan, and remove from heat. Allow the couscous to stand until all the water has been absorbed, about 5 minutes; fluff with a fork. Allow the couscous to cool to warm temperature.
