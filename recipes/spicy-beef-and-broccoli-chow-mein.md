## Ingredients

- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons chile sauce  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ pound thinly-cut flat iron steaks
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 6 ounces dried chow mein noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
- ¼  white onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, red wine vinegar, sesame oil, garlic powder, honey, chile sauce, and black pepper together in a bowl until marinade is smooth. Brush marinade onto steak strips and broccoli, reserving some for the noodles. Refrigerate for 4 hours to overnight.
