## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, cardamom pods, whole cloves, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Cook until spices start to sputter, about 1 minute. Stir in onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is softened and just starting to brown, about 5 minutes.
