## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork belly, cut into 3/4-inch cubes
- 2 teaspoons Chinese cooking wine
- 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ½ tablespoon fried shallots  (Optional)
- 3 cups water
- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dark soy sauce
- ¼ pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons frozen peas
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 cups cooked jasmine rice, cooled, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon light soy sauce
- 3 drops sesame oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix pork belly with cooking wine, oyster sauce, cornstarch, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 20 minutes.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add garlic and shallots; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the pork pieces; fry until browned, about 6 minutes. Pour in water, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Cover with a lid and bring stew to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook until pork becomes tender and water is reduced by half, about 30 minutes.
3. Cut shrimp into 3/4-inch pieces. Mix cornstarch and water together in a bowl.
4. Bring stew to a boil. Add the shrimp and peas; cook until shrimp changes color, about 2 minutes. Quickly stir in the cornstarch mixture. Cook and stir until gravy is thickened, 7 to 10 minutes.
5. Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Saute garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Increase heat to high. Add rice; cook, breaking up the rice with a spatula, until loosened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add oyster sauce and soy sauce. Cook and stir until rice is fluffy and heated through, about 3 minutes. Add remaining sesame oil.
6. Divide fried rice between 3 or 4 bowls. Portion the pork and shrimp stew equally over the rice.
