## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground fennel seed  (Optional)
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)
- 1  mango - peeled, seeded and diced
- 1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
- ½  red bell pepper, chopped
- ½ cup black beans, rinsed and drained  (Optional)
- ½  red onion, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup milk
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon dried unsweetened coconut, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 5 (4 ounce) fillets tilapia

## Instructions

1. Mix together paprika, curry powder, cumin, allspice, ginger, coriander, salt, black pepper, fennel, and cayenne pepper in a bowl; set aside.
2. In a bowl, lightly toss mango, pineapple, red bell pepper, black beans, red onion, and cilantro in a bowl; pour lime juice over mango mixture and toss again. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
3. Whisk together egg and milk in a bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, stir panko crumbs with coconut. Stir about 1 tablespoon of the spice mix, or to taste, into the panko crumb mixture.
4. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tilapia fillets into egg mixture, then press gently into panko crumb mixture to coat both sides of fillets. Brush off any loose crumbs, then lay fillets into the hot oil. Pan-fry until fish is opaque inside and golden brown outside, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve with mango salsa.
