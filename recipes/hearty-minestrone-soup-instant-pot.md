## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) on Saute mode. Add beef and onion; cook until beef is no longer pink on the outside, about 4 minutes. Add celery, green beans, carrot, garlic, oregano, dried basil, and pepper. Stir to combine.
2. Pour broth, diced tomatoes, and crushed tomatoes into the pot with the beef. Stir well. Select Soup setting; close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
3. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in kidney beans and pasta.
