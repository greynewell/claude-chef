## Ingredients

- 8  tilapia fillets
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon garlic paste
- 6 large tomatoes, seeded and diced
- 1  avocado, diced  (Optional)
- 1  red onion, chopped
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely diced, or more to taste
- 4 sprigs cilantro, finely chopped  (Optional)
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- ⅔ cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed
- 16 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
- 6 cups shredded cabbage

## Instructions

1. Cut each tilapia fillet into 2 strips each.
2. Mix olive oil, chili powder, cumin, coriander, and garlic paste together for marinade. Add fish strips, coat well, and set aside to soak.
3. Mix tomatoes, avocado, red onion, jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl for pico de gallo.
