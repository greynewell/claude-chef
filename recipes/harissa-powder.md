## Ingredients

- 10  dried, smoked chile peppers
- 2 tablespoons cumin seeds
- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds
- 2 tablespoons caraway seeds
- ½ teaspoon multi-colored whole peppercorns
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- ½ tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked salt
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

## Instructions

1. Remove and discard stems and seeds from dried chiles. Slice chiles in half or quarters, if they are large.
2. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Add chiles and heat through to ensure any moisture has evaporated. Transfer chiles to a wired rack to cool.
3. Place cumin, coriander, caraway, and peppercorns into the same skillet over medium-low heat. Stir until seeds are toasted and fragrant but not burning, about 3 minutes. Transfer seeds to a plate and allow to cool.
4. Grind chiles and toasted seeds with a mortar and pestle into a coarse powder. Add smoked paprika, garlic powder, smoked salt, parsley, and oregano. Continue to blend until all spices are completely combined and pulverized.
