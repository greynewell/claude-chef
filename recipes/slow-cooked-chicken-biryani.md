## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups basmati rice
- ¼ cup vegetable oil, divided
- 4  cinnamon sticks
- 8  whole cloves
- 4 pods black cardamom
- 2  onions, sliced
- 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
- ¼ cup chopped fresh mint
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 ½ pounds boneless chicken breast, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¾ cup fat-free yogurt
- 4  green chile peppers
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon ground chile pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 10 cups water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds

## Instructions

1. Place basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water. Let soak, about 30 minutes. Drain.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add cinnamon sticks, 8 cloves, and 4 black cardamom pods; fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onions; cook and stir until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger-garlic paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Sprinkle mint and cilantro on top; cook 1 minute more.
3. Stir chicken into the skillet; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook and stir until chicken is browned, about 20 minutes. Stir in yogurt, green chile peppers, lemon juice, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, chile pepper, and turmeric. Cook until oil begins to separate from the sauce, 10 to 20 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
4. Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, 2 green cardamom pods, 2 cloves, and bay leaves; boil for 1 minute. Add drained rice. Bring water back up to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and drain, reserving whole spices in the rice.
5. Spoon chicken mixture into a slow cooker. Top with partially cooked rice; mix together.
6. Cook on High until rice is tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
