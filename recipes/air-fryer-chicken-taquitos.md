## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons diced onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped green chiles (such as Ortega®)
- 2 tablespoons Mexican-style hot tomato sauce (such as El Pato®)
- 1 cup shredded rotisserie chicken
- 2 tablespoons Neufchatel cheese
- ½ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 each corn tortillas
- 1  serving avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add green chiles and Mexican tomato sauce; stir to combine. Add shredded chicken, Mexican cheese blend, and Neufchâtel cheese. Cook and stir until cheeses have melted and mixture is warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat tortillas in a skillet or directly on the grates of a gas stove until soft and pliable. Place 3 tablespoons of chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Fold over and roll into taquitos.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Place taquitos in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching, and mist with avocado oil. Cook until golden brown, 6 to 9 minutes. Turn taquitos over, mist with avocado oil, and air fry until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
