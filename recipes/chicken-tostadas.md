## Ingredients

- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
- ½ (1 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
- 1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
- 6  corn tostada shells
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 1  tomato, diced
- ¾  red onion, diced
- ¾  green bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ¼ cup salsa, or to taste  (Optional)
- ¼ cup sour cream, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place chicken into a frying pan over medium heat. Sprinkle with taco seasoning and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
3. Spread a thin layer of refried beans onto each tostada shell; sprinkle each with Mexican cheese. Divide cooked chicken on top of cheese layer. Sprinkle tomato, red onion, and bell pepper evenly on top of each tostada. Place tostadas on a baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until crispy, 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Remove tostadas from the oven. Sprinkle with cilantro and spread salsa and sour cream on top.
