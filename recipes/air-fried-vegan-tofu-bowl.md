## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package extra-firm tofu
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 3 medium (blank)s carrots, peeled and sliced
- ⅓ cup frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
- ½ teaspoon everything bagel seasoning, divided
- 1 drop soy sauce
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 drop chili oil, or to taste
- 2 cups cooked brown rice
- 1  avocado, diced
- ¼ teaspoon furikake (Japanese nori seasoning), or to taste
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top. Press tofu for 20 to 30 minutes; drain and discard the accumulated liquid.
2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions.
3. Cut the tofu into cubes by cutting it lengthwise and then cutting the thin tofu blocks into eight pieces. Roll them in 1 tablespoon cornstarch.
4. Cook in the preheated air fryer until browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the preheated oven.
5. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, edamame, 1/4 teaspoon everything bagel seasoning, and a drop of soy sauce; cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes.
6. While the veggies are steaming, add remaining soy sauce, brown sugar, and chili oil to a pan and combine. Stir in remaining cornstarch to thicken, adding a bit of water if it's too thick. Bring to a simmer. Transfer the tofu to a bowl and coat it in the warm sauce. Sprinkle with remaining everything bagel seasoning.
7. Add the cooked rice to a bowl, top with the veggies and tofu, avocado, and sprinkle with furikake and pepper flakes. Enjoy while warm.
