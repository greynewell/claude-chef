## Ingredients

- 1 (20 ounce) can crushed pineapple in juice
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup shoyu (Japanese soy sauce)
- ⅓ cup ketchup
- ⅓ cup red wine
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 drops liquid smoke, or more to taste  (Optional)
- 3 (3 1/2) pound fryer chickens, quartered

## Instructions

1. Stir pineapple, brown sugar, shoyu, ketchup, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, ginger, garlic, and liquid smoke together in a pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes. Cool completely. Transfer 1 1/2 cups sauce to a bowl and refrigerate.
2. Place chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour remaining sauce over the top; toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken from marinade; discard used marinade.
5. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to low and cook, turning and basting frequently with reserved 1 1/2 cups pineapple sauce, until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
