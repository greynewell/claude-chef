## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- ⅓ cup salted butter
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- 1  jalapeno pepper, sliced
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
- ¾ cup dry white wine
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 24  peeled and deveined medium shrimp
- 1 (4 ounce) jar capers
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes; drain.
2. While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Stir olive oil, jalapeno pepper, and red pepper flakes into the melted butter; cook until the flavors of the peppers infuse into the butter mixture, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard the jalapeno slices if desired; they will make this dish really hot if you leave them in.
3. Stir white wine into the butter mixture; cook another 5 minutes. Add shrimp and capers. Increase heat to medium; cook and stir the shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.
4. Add drained pasta to the shrimp mixture; toss to coat. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.
