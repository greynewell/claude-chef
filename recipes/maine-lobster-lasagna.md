## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 2  eggs
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 medium onion, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo pasta sauce
- 16  no-boil lasagna noodles
- 2 pounds cooked and cubed lobster meat
- 1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Place ricotta cheese into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and eggs. Mix in onion, parsley, garlic, and pepper.
3. Spread 1 1/2 cups Alfredo sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of 4 lasagna noodles. Arrange 1/3 of the lobster meat over noodles, then cover with 1/3 of the spinach and another layer Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers twice more: noodles, lobster meat, spinach, and sauce. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan over top. Give the whole pan a gentle shake to get everything settled in.
4. Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until cheese is browned, about 10 more minutes.
5. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.
