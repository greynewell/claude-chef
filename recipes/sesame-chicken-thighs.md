## Ingredients

- ½ cup chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons chopped garlic
- 4  bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a deep, oven-safe dish with aluminum foil.
2. Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and garlic together in a small bowl.
3. Place chicken in the prepared dish. Pour sauce over chicken and turn until fully coated.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sesame seeds over chicken, and continue to bake until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Sprinkle remaining sesame seeds over chicken before serving.
