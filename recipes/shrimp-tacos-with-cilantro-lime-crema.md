- 1 teaspoon freshly minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon grated Valencia orange zest
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons sour cream
- 1  lime, zested and juiced
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh cilantro
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper
- 20 (6 inch) corn tortillas

## Instructions

1. Rinse defrosted shrimp under cold water, drain, and pat dry.
2. Combine shrimp, chili powder, garlic, paprika, cumin, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, coriander, and orange zest in a bowl. Mix well.
3. Heat olive oil in nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 4 to 5 minutes on each side, depending on the size of the shrimp.
4. While shrimp cooks, prepare crema by whisking together sour cream, zest and juice of 1 lime, 1 teaspoon cilantro, garlic powder, and 1 pinch each of salt and black pepper.
5. Heat corn tortillas in either a pan or on a griddle over low heat, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Be careful not to let them burn. Set aside.
6. Assemble tacos by spreading 1 teaspoon crema across each tortilla, adding 3 or 4 shrimp, 2 slices of avocado, a sprinkle of fresh red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno. Serve with sliced limes to squeeze on top and extra crema on the side.
