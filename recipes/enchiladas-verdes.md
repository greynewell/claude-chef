## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic
- 3  serrano peppers
- 2 ¼ pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
- 9  corn tortillas
- 3 cups water
- 4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules
- ½  store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded
- ¼ head iceberg lettuce, shredded
- 1 cup cilantro leaves
- 1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca
- 1 cup grated cotija cheese

## Instructions

1. Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high.
2. Cook tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic on the hot griddle, turning occasionally, until toasted and blackened — about 5 minutes for garlic, 10 minutes for peppers, and 15 minutes for tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.
3. Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Lightly fry tortillas, one at a time, in hot oil until warmed through, 3 to 5 seconds per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
5. Place toasted tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a blender. Add water and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve chicken bouillon in the mixture, reduce heat, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
6. Soak tortillas in sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds. Fill each tortilla with shredded chicken and sprinkle with sauce. Roll up tortillas and place seam-side down in a serving dish.
7. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over rolled tortillas. Top with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour remaining sauce on top or serve on the side.
