## Ingredients

- 2 cups farfalle pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, but do not rinse. Let sit for 2 minutes.
2. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Meanwhile, transfer pasta to a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil; stir in Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and salt until evenly combined. Arrange 1/4 of the pasta in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
4. Cook in the preheated air fryer for 5 minutes; flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and break apart any pasta chips that have stuck together; let cool completely. Repeat with remaining pasta.
