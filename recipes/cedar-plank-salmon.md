## Ingredients

- 1 (12 inch) cedar plank
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon dried dill weed
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 3 tablespoons water
- 4 (6 ounce) salmon fillets, with skin
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce  (Optional)
- 1  lemon, cut into wedges  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
2. Combine brown sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and dill in a small bowl. Mix in a little water at a time, adding just enough to make the mixture liquid. Stir in soy sauce and season with pepper.
3. Place salmon fillets on the soaked plank, skin-side down. Spoon the brown sugar mixture evenly over the fillets so they are fully coated.
4. Place plank and salmon on a rack in the preheated oven and bake until fish flakes easily with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
