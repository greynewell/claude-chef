## Ingredients

- 1 cup pimento-stuffed green olives, crushed
- ½ cup drained kalamata olives, crushed
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup roughly chopped pickled cauliflower florets
- 2 tablespoons drained capers
- 1 tablespoon chopped celery
- 1 tablespoon chopped carrot
- ½ cup pepperoncini, drained
- ¼ cup marinated cocktail onions
- ½ teaspoon celery seed
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- ½ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup canola oil
- 2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread
- 8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami
- 8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham
- 8 ounces sliced mortadella
- 8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese
- 8 ounces sliced provolone cheese

## Instructions

1. Make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot. Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed. Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.
2. Make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling. Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil. Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices. Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.
3. Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.
