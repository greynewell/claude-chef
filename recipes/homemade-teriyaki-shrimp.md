## Ingredients

- 1 pound frozen raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ½ cup coconut aminos
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons water
- 2 cups steamed white rice
- 1 tablespoon sliced green onions  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place frozen shrimp in a single layer on a metal pan and set aside.
2. Combine coconut aminos, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil in a large skillet. Bring to a boil over medium heat, 3 to 4 minutes.
