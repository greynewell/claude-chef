## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ medium head green cabbage, shredded
- 3  scallions, thinly sliced
- 5 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4  tilapia fillets, or more to taste
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- ¾ cup mayonnaise
- 1  lime, juiced, divided
- 2 teaspoons minced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, or to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- ½ cup crumbled queso fresco

## Instructions

1. Whisk cider vinegar, vegetable oil, and salt together in a small bowl. Combine cabbage, scallions, and cilantro in a separate bowl. Pour vinegar mixture over top and toss to coat; set cabbage slaw aside.
2. Combine chili powder, salt, coriander, cumin, and pepper in a bowl. Pat fish dry and rub with vegetable oil. Rub fish evenly with spice mixture. Place fish on a wire rack and refrigerate until grill is ready.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat with the lid down for 10 to 15 minutes.
4. While the grill is heating, combine mayonnaise, 1/2 of the lime juice, chipotle peppers, and garlic in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
5. Scrape the hot grill grate until clean. Dip a paper towel in vegetable oil and quickly rub it over the grate. Lay fish on the grill, perpendicular to the bars of the grate.
6. Cook until fish is opaque and flakes apart when gently prodded, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Tear fish apart into a bowl and pour remaining lime juice over top.
7. Place several tortillas in a single layer on the grill and cook until warm, about 10 seconds per side. Transfer to a tortilla warmer and repeat to warm remaining tortillas.
8. Smear warm tortillas with mayonnaise mixture, then add fish, cabbage slaw, and queso fresco.
