## Ingredients

- 1 cup canned roasted red peppers, drained
- 2 cups chicken broth
- ⅔ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, packed
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper
- 1 teaspoon chopped garlic, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or more to taste
- 1 (12 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 5 (4 ounce) fillets boneless salmon fillets

## Instructions

1. Preheat outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Puree roasted red peppers in a food processor; transfer to a cold large skillet.
3. Stir chicken broth, Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup cilantro, cornstarch, jalapeno pepper, and garlic into red pepper puree.
4. Bring red pepper mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Keep warm.
5. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir angel hair and olive oil into the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
6. Cook salmon, skin side up, until skin begins to loosen, about 5 minutes. Remove from grill and peel skin. Continue cooking on other side until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes.
7. Divide angel hair pasta among 5 warm plates. Nestle a salmon fillet into each pasta portion. Drizzle red pepper sauce around salmon onto pasta. Garnish with 1 tablespoon cilantro and chives.
