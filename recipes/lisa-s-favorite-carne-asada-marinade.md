## Ingredients

- ¾ cup orange juice
- ½ cup lemon juice
- ⅓ cup lime juice
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped canned chipotle pepper
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 tablespoon black pepper
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- ½ cup olive oil
- 3 pounds flank steak

## Instructions

1. Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.
2. Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.
3. Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
4. When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
5. Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
6. Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.
7. Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain. Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately.
