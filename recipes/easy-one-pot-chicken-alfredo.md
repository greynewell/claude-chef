## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ¾ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 16 ounces tricolor rotini pasta
- 1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or more to taste
- ¼ cup Greek yogurt

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chicken, onion, and garlic. Season with salt and black pepper, and cook until lightly browned and chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle flour over chicken. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and almond milk. Season with basil, oregano, and nutmeg. Stir to combine.
2. Mix in rotini pasta and bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until sauce is slightly thickened and pasta is cooked, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese and Greek yogurt. Season with additional salt and black pepper to taste. Mixture will thicken as it cools. Serve topped with additional Parmesan cheese, if desired.
