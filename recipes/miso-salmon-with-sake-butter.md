## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 cup short-grain white rice
- 1 cup snow peas
- cooking spray
- 4 (6 ounce) 1-inch thick salmon fillets
- ¼ cup brown sugar, packed
- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons hot water
- 2 tablespoons miso (soybean paste)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons peeled, matchstick-cut fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced shallots
- ½ cup sake (Japanese rice wine, such as Momokawa®)
- 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
- 1 tablespoon sake (Japanese rice wine, such as Momokawa®)
- ½ teaspoon fresh lime juice
- kosher salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives

## Instructions

1. Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
2. While rice cooks, place snow peas on top of rice and steam, covered, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer snow peas to a bowl to stop cooking; set aside.
3. Preheat the oven broiler. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
4. Arrange salmon fillets on the prepared baking dish. Whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, hot water, and miso in a small bowl until combined; spoon over salmon.
5. Broil in the preheated oven, basting frequently with soy sauce mixture, until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.
6. While salmon cooks, make sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ginger and shallots; cook and stir until shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sake; bring to a boil and cook until reduced by 2/3, about 3 minutes. Add heavy cream; bring to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
7. Whisk in butter, one cube at a time, until incorporated and sauce is thick and creamy. Remove from heat. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon sake and lime juice. Season with salt.
8. Spoon some sake sauce onto 4 serving plates. Place rice in the middle of each and top with a salmon fillet. Arrange snow peas around each plate. Garnish with chives.
