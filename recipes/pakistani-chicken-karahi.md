## Ingredients

- ½ cup sunflower oil
- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets discarded, cut into 12 pieces
- ¼ cup water
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 ½ teaspoons ginger and garlic paste
- ½ teaspoon red chile powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 6  ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 4  green chile peppers, finely chopped, or more to taste
- 1 bunch fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot or karahi over high heat. Add chicken pieces and cook until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Add water, cumin, salt, ginger and garlic paste, red chile powder, and turmeric; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
