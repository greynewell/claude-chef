## Ingredients

- 2 pounds fresh tomatillos, husks removed
- 10  dried chile de arbol peppers
- 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
- salt to taste
- 10  guajillo chile peppers - stems, seeds, and veins removed
- 5  pasilla chile peppers - stems, seeds, and veins removed
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- ¼ cup orange juice
- 1 clove garlic
- 3  whole cloves
- 1 pinch ground cumin
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds skinless trout fillets
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 large onion, finely chopped, divided
- 1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
- 12  corn tortillas
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 4  limes, cut into wedges for garnish

## Instructions

1. Wash tomatillos under cold running water.
2. Line a heavy cast iron grill pan or griddle with aluminum foil and place over high heat. Arrange tomatillos, chiles de arbol, and 2 cloves garlic in a single layer on top. Grill until chiles are blackened, turning as necessary, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Continue grilling tomatillos and garlic until they are evenly blackened, 8 to 10 minutes more.
3. Peel garlic and place in a mortar and pestle. Season with salt and pound into a thick paste. Add chiles; pound until smooth. Add as many tomatillos as you can fit in your mortar; pound until chunky. Transfer salsa to a bowl. Repeat with remaining tomatillos, mixing them into the bowl of salsa in batches.
4. Place guajillo and pasilla chile peppers in a saucepan, cover with water, and cook until softened, about 25 minutes.
5. Combine softened peppers, vinegar, orange juice, 1 clove garlic, cloves, cumin, salt, and pepper in a blender; blend until smooth. Add some water if sauce is too thick. Strain into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, about 5 minutes.
6. Season trout fillets with pepper and put in a lidded container or a large resealable plastic bag. Cover with cooled sauce and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.
7. Remove trout fillets from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Remove from sauce and cut into cubes. Reserve marinade.
8. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook 1/2 the onion until soft and translucent, about 3 minutes. Add trout and reserved sauce; cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until trout is opaque and the sauce has been reduced, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in pineapple.
9. Warm corn tortillas in a skillet. Divide trout mixture amongst tortillas and top with remaining 1/2 onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges and charred tomatillo salsa.
