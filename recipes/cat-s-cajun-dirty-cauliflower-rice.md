- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (10 ounce) bag frozen seasoning blend (onions, celery, and green and red bell peppers)
- 4 cups shredded cauliflower (such as Green Giant™ Cauliflower Crumbles®)
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
- 1 (14 ounce) can beef broth
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®)
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon onion salt
- 1  bay leaf
- ½ cup chopped green onions

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain grease. Transfer beef to a plate and set aside.
