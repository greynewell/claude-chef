## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups moong dal (split husked mung beans)
- 2 ½ cups water
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon diced jalapeno chile pepper
- ½ cup diced tomatoes
- 3 teaspoons lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seed
