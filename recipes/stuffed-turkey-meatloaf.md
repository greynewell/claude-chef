## Ingredients

- cooking spray (such as Pam®)
- 1 pound ground turkey
- ⅜ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs
- ½  onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 large egg
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- 1 pinch onion powder, or to taste
- ¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 ounce chopped baby spinach
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ½ teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray (such as Pam®).
2. Mix turkey, bread crumbs, onion, ketchup, egg, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder together in a large bowl.
3. Spread meat mixture over a sheet of parchment paper to form a large square or rectangle. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and spinach over 1/2 of the meat mixture. Fold other 1/2 of mixture gently over filled side. Press together and shape into a log. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.
5. In the meantime, mix ketchup, Worcestershire, Dijon, brown sugar, and garlic powder for glaze together in a bowl.
6. Remove meatloaf from the oven; pour glaze over. Return to the oven and bake until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
