## Ingredients

- 2 pounds skinless halibut fillets, cut into large pieces
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, finely chopped
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
- 8  flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2  avocados - peeled, pitted, and sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Season the halibut with garlic powder, salt, and pepper; cook in microwave until slightly cooked, about 2 minutes. Mix together the green onion, bell pepper, cilantro, sour cream, mayonnaise and 1 cup Cheddar cheese in a bowl. Gently fold the halibut into the mixture.
3. Prepare a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray. Pour 1/2 of a can of enchilada sauce into the bottom of the baking dish.
4. Pour 1 can of enchilada sauce into a bowl. Dip the tortillas, one at a time, into the sauce to lightly coat. Spoon the halibut in equal portions into the center of each tortilla. Make the enchiladas by tightly rolling the tortillas and place seam-side down in the baking dish. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over top of the enchiladas. Sprinkle with 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil
5. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Top with avocado slices to serve.
