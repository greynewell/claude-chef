## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or to taste
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into cubes
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2  jalapeno peppers, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 quart chicken broth
- 1 (8 ounce) jar salsa
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 (15.5 ounce) cans white (cannellini) beans, drained and rinsed

## Instructions

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, green bell pepper, and onion in hot oil until the chicken is browned and the vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
