## Instructions

1. Preheat an indoor or outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
2. Whisk together the coriander, cumin, cardamom, chili powder, grill seasoning, paprika, and turmeric in a bowl; whisk in juice of 1/2 lemon, garlic, and 3 tablespoons olive oil to form a paste.
3. Coat the chicken breasts with the spice paste.
4. Grill chicken breasts on the preheated grill until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink at the center, about 6 minutes per side.
5. Transfer chicken to a plate and cool for 1 to 2 minutes; slice thinly.
6. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Stir onion, red pepper, and yellow pepper into the hot olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
8. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
9. Stir together Greek yogurt, tahini, juice of remaining 1/2 lemon, and remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a bowl until smooth; season with salt.
10. Place pitas on the grill until heated through and lightly charred on the outside, about 1 minute per side.
