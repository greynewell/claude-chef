## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½  onion, finely chopped
- 1 ½ (14.5 ounce) cans passata (crushed tomatoes)
- salt to taste
- 1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cubed
- 4  fresh basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add passata and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.
