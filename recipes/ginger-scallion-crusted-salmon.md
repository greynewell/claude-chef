## Instructions

1. To make the cucumber salad, stir together sesame oil, dill, rice vinegar, mirin, and sesame seeds in a glass or plastic bowl; add cucumber, and toss until well coated.
2. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
3. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
4. To prepare the ginger crust, stir together the ginger, green onions, and garlic in a sturdy, metal bowl; set aside.
5. Heat 1/4 cup peanut oil in a small saucepan over high heat until it begins to smoke.
6. Remove from heat, and carefully stir in the ginger mixture; set aside.
7. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
8. Heat 2 tablespoons peanut oil in a large, ovenproof, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
9. Season salmon fillets to taste with salt and pepper.
10. Sear salmon until golden brown on both sides, 30 to 40 seconds per side.

18. Remove from heat, then whisk in cold butter pieces until dissolved; season to taste with kosher salt.
