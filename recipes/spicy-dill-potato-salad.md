## Instructions

1. Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water.

3. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two.
4. Place the potatoes into a large bowl, and chill in the refrigerator until cold, about 1 hour.
5. While the potatoes are boiling, place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch.
6. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat.
7. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes.

9. Peel once cold.
10. Chop the eggs, and place into the bowl with the potatoes.
11. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
12. Cut the bell peppers in half, and remove the seeds, core, and stems.
13. Place the bell peppers onto a baking sheet, cut sides down.
14. Cut the onion in half, and place it onto the baking sheet, cut sides down.
15. Roast the peppers and onion in the preheated oven until the skin of the vegetables has charred in places, about 25 minutes.
16. Remove any large pieces of burned skin, and chop the peppers and onions.
17. Transfer into the bowl with the potatoes and eggs.
18. In a bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, horseradish mustard, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, dill, garlic, cumin, and salt and pepper until thoroughly combined.
