## Ingredients

- 2 (15 ounce) cans garbanzo beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ⅔ large onion, roughly chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large eggs
- 1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Combine garbanzo beans, parsley, cilantro, onion, garlic, eggs, jalapeno, flour, olive oil, cumin, coriander, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; process until mixture is coarsely pureed. Transfer falafel mixture to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 8 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Remove falafel mixture from the refrigerator. Add more flour if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, and form into 20 small patties. Place patties on a baking sheet.
4. Cook in the preheated oven until patties are golden brown and feel dry to the touch, but still give a little when you press the middle, about 25 minutes.
