## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh shrimp, peeled, deveined and finely minced
- ½  yellow onion, minced
- ½ cup finely chopped water chestnuts
- ½ cup finely chopped celery
- 1  green onion, finely chopped
- ½ cup cooked crabmeat
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil

- 5 drops soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 cups oil for frying
- 8 thick slices white bread
- ¼ cup soy sauce

- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, onion, water chestnuts, celery, and green onion. Stir in crabmeat, egg, parsley, sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Make the dipping sauce: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, water, sesame oil, parsley, garlic powder, and sugar; set aside.
3. In a heavy skillet, heat 2 cups oil, or enough to be 1/2 inch deep, over medium heat. Spread a thick layer of shrimp filling on one side of each slice of bread.
