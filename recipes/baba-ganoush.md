## Ingredients

- 1 pound eggplant
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons tahini
- 2 cloves garlic
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cumin
- ⅛ teaspoon red chile powder
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ tablespoon plain yogurt, or more to taste
- salt to taste
- 1 pinch paprika

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking sheet.
2. Halve eggplants and brush cut sides with olive oil. Place face-down onto the prepared baking sheet.
3. Roast in the preheated oven until softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool, about 30 minutes.
