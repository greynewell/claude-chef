## Ingredients

- 14 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced
- 1  egg white, beaten
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package Chinese egg noodles
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- ½ cup chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Mix chicken with egg white, 2 teaspoons cornstarch, and sesame oil in a bowl.

5. Pour chicken stock into the wok; stir in spring onions, soy sauce, rice wine, white pepper, and black pepper.
