## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup red wine
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ pounds flank steak, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness
- 1 clove garlic, peeled
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup chopped onion
- ¼ cup fine dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Prepare the steak: Combine olive oil, soy sauce, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon, lemon juice, garlic, Italian seasoning, and pepper in a large zip-top bag. Squeeze the bag to blend the ingredients well.
2. Pierce flank steak with a knife, making small slits about 1 inch apart. Place steak in the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
3. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Make the filling: Place crushed garlic on a cutting board. Sprinkle salt over top and scrape with the flat side of a knife to make a paste.
5. Remove steak from the bag and place on a work surface; discard marinade. Spread garlic paste over the top side of the steak. Layer with chopped onion, bread crumbs, spinach, and feta cheese. Starting at one of the short ends, roll steak lengthwise around the filling; secure with kitchen twine or toothpicks. Transfer to a shallow glass baking dish.
6. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the roll is at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees F) in the center, about 1 hour.
7. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes so filling can set. Slice into 1-inch slices to serve.
