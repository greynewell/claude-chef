## Ingredients

- 20 ounces prepared pizza dough
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- 1 cup pizza sauce, divided
- 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, divided
- ½ cup cooked Italian sausage, or to taste
- ½ cup cooked mushrooms, or to taste
- ½ cup cooked red onions, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/8-inch thick circle on a lightly floured surface.
2. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and brush with oil. Add 1 piece of dough and reduce heat to medium. Cook for 2 minutes and flip. Spread 1/4 of the sauce over the dough. Sprinkle 1/4 of the mozzarella cheese and some sausage, mushrooms, and red onion on top, leaving about 1/2 inch of dough around the outside. Press gently into the middle of the dough with a spatula to make a crease; fold in half.
3. Brush crust with a little more olive oil and flip over. Repeat on the other side and continue cooking until both sides of the pizzadilla are as browned and crisp as you like.
4. Repeat with remaining pizza dough and toppings. Cut each pizzadilla in half and serve.
