## Ingredients

- ¼ cup fresh orange juice
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 (3 ounce) halibut cheeks

## Instructions

1. Whisk the orange juice, cilantro, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl; set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the halibut cheeks until golden brown on each side, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour the orange juice mixture into the skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the halibut flakes easily with a fork and the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove halibut cheeks to a plate and drizzle with orange sauce to serve.
