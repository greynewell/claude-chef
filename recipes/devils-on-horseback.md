## Ingredients

- 20  wooden toothpicks
- ¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¾ cup dark brown sugar
- 20  dates, pitted and left whole
- 20  whole smoked almonds
- 10  bacon slices, cut in half crosswise

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Soak the toothpicks in a bowl of water. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. In a bowl, mix together the soy sauce and ground ginger. Place the brown sugar into a shallow bowl. Spread open a pitted date, then stuff it with a smoked almond. Wrap the date with half a bacon slice, secure it with a toothpick, dip the bundle in soy sauce mixture, and then dip it into brown sugar. Place the wrapped dates into the prepared baking dish. If desired, sprinkle a little more brown sugar over the bundles.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and crisp, 15 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before serving; serve warm or at room temperature.
