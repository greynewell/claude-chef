## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  cooked chicken breasts, shredded, or more to taste
- 2 (10 ounce) cans green enchilada sauce
- ⅔ cup red enchilada sauce
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.
2. Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion in hot oil until slightly softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir red bell pepper and garlic into onion; sauté until fragrant and softened, another 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Stir chicken, green enchilada sauce, red enchilada sauce, diced green chiles, chili powder, cumin, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavors blend, 8 to 10 minutes. Add Colby-Jack cheese and stir until melted and heated through, 1 to 3 minutes.
4. Reduce heat to low and stir sour cream into enchilada mixture; cook and stir until heated through. Pour enchilada mixture over penne pasta and toss to coat completely.
