## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- ¾ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ pound chow mein noodles
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 heads   bok choy, chopped
- ½  zucchini, diced
- 10  sugar snap peas
- 1  carrot, cut into thin strips
- 2 tablespoons chopped green onion

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, corn starch, and sesame oil together in a large bowl until smooth; add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
2. Combine chicken broth, oyster sauce, and sugar in a small bowl and set aside.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet. Cook and garlic in hot oil for 30 seconds; add marinated chicken. Cook and stir until browned and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove chicken mixture to a plate. Cook and stir bok choy, zucchini, snap peas, and carrot in the hot skillet until softened, about 2 minutes. Return noodles and chicken mixture to the skillet. Pour broth mixture into noodle mixture; cook and stir until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Serve garnished with green onions.
