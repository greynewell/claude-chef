## Ingredients

- 1 medium lemon, halved crosswise
- 1 (1 pound) fillet cod, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 (8 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese
- 1 medium bell pepper, diced
- 1 small zucchini, cut in quarters lengthwise and then crosswise into thin slices
- 1 small red onion, diced
- ½ cup halved Kalamata olives
- ½ cup halved green olives
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 medium bell peppers, tops cut off and seeded

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Cut one lemon half into 1/4-inch thick slices; remove any rind and quarter each slice. Juice the other half.
3. Combine cod, feta cheese, diced bell pepper, zucchini, onion, Kalamata and green olives, and lemon slices in a mixing bowl. Mix in oregano and season with salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and olive oil; toss gently to coat all ingredients.
4. Stuff peppers with the cod mixture. Wrap all peppers together in heavy-duty aluminum foil, creating a sealed pouch.
5. Bake in the oven until peppers are tender and cod is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
