1. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and serrano and cook until onions are soft and translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Season with more salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
2. Divide shrimp mixture into 8 equal portions. Set aside.
3. Melt 1/2 teaspoon bacon drippings in a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Place 1 tortilla on bacon drippings. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons cheese and 1 portion shrimp mixture to one side of the tortilla. Fold over and cook until tortilla is semi-crisp and cheese has started to melt, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip taco onto other side and cook to desired crispiness, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
