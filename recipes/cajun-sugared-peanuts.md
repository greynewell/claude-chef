## Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup water
- 2 cups raw peanuts
- 1 ½ teaspoons chipotle chile powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Stir sugar into water in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until the sugar dissolves completely. Add peanuts, chipotle chile powder, kosher salt, chili powder, and garlic powder into the liquid.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid evaporates and the remaining syrup coats the nuts, about 15 minutes; spread immediately onto the prepared baking sheet. Use forks to separate any peanuts stuck together and to get an even layer.
4. Bake in preheated oven, stirring and then separating the peanuts every 5 minutes, until the peanuts are glazed, about 20 minutes total. Let peanuts cool completely before breaking into small pieces.
