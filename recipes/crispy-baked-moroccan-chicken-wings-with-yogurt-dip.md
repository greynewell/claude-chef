## Ingredients

- 2 ½ pounds chicken wings
- 1 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- Reynolds Wrap® Non Stick Aluminum Foil
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 ½ tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
2. Place chicken wings into a large bowl, drizzle with oil, and toss until thoroughly coated.
3. Stir paprika, cumin, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture over wings and toss to coat.
4. Arrange wings in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them apart so they aren't touching.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
6. Meanwhile, make the yogurt dip: Stir yogurt, lemon juice, honey, mint, cilantro, salt, and pepper together in a small bowl. Taste dip and season with additional salt and pepper as desired.
7. Remove wings from the oven and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with yogurt dip.
