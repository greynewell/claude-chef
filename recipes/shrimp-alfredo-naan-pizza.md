## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- aluminum foil
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- ⅓ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ⅓ cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- ⅓ cup chopped zucchini
- ⅓ cup broccoli florets
- ⅓ cup cauliflower florets
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ pound butter
- 8 fluid ounces heavy cream
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 (8.8 ounce) packages 2-pack garlic naan bread
- ½ cup shredded Italian cheese blend, or to taste
- ½ cup shredded Asiago cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 3 baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
2. Combine onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli, and cauliflower in a medium bowl. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix to combine. Place on 1 of the prepared baking sheets.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove vegetables and set aside. Lower oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add heavy cream and Parmesan cheese; cook and stir until sauce is smooth and starts to thicken, about 10 minutes.
5. At the same time, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in garlic and cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pat shrimp with paper towels to remove any moisture and add them to the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until shrimp are pink, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Place 2 naans on each of the 2 remaining foil-lined baking sheets. Lightly spray tops of naans with cooking spray. Spoon some Parmesan-cream sauce on each naan, spreading it all the way to the edge. Arrange cooked vegetables on top of the sauce, followed by the cooked shrimp. Spoon the remaining sauce over shrimp and top with shredded Italian and Asiago cheeses.
7. Bake naan pizzas until cheese is melted and naans are starting to get crispy at the bottom, 10 to 15 minutes.
