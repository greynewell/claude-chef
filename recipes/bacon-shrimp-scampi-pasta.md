## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti (such as Barilla® Spaghetti Rigati)
- 4 slices bacon, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 12 ounces jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- ½ cup chicken broth
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 3 wedges fresh lemon

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly tender, about 8 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels, leaving about 1 1/2 tablespoons grease in the skillet.
3. Add garlic to hot grease and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp and sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Cook until just cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
4. Pour chicken broth into the hot skillet, and cook for about 1 minute. Stir in heavy cream, and bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, whisk in Parmesan cheese, and cook until sauce starts to thicken, about 2 minutes.
5. Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.
6. Return shrimp and bacon to the skillet and simmer until heated through, about 1 minute. Add spaghetti and toss all ingredients together. Whisk in some of the reserved pasta water if sauce is too thick. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with a fresh lemon wedge to be squeezed over the pasta.
