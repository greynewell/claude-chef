## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons garlic salt
- 8 (5 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 1 pinch onion salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- 1 cup white vinegar
- ½ cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place eggs in a bowl. Combine cornstarch and garlic salt in a second bowl.
3. Dip chicken in egg, then coat in cornstarch mixture.
4. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken in the hot oil on all sides, sprinkling with onion salt, garlic salt, and pepper while frying, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Combine sugar, vinegar, ketchup, and soy sauce in a bowl.
6. Place browned chicken in a 9x13-inch casserole dish and pour sauce over top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 40 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
