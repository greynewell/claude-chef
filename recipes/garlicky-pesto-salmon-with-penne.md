## Ingredients

- 1 pound penne pasta
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless salmon fillets
- 4 tablespoons salted butter
- 1 cup fresh asparagus tips
- 1 cup quartered artichoke hearts
- ½ cup chopped green onions
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream
- ¼ cup pesto
- 1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water; set aside.
2. Meanwhile, cut salmon into small pieces.
3. Melt butter in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add salmon and stir a few times. Add asparagus tips, artichoke hearts, green onions, garlic, salt, and pepper. Saute until salmon is almost cooked, garlic is golden, and asparagus is tender, about 5 minutes.
4. Add cream and bring to a boil. Stir in pesto. Boil until sauce is reduced by at least 1/4 to 1/2. Add penne and toss thoroughly to coat.
5. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley and serve hot.
