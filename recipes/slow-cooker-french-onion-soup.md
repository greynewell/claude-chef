## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons butter
- 4 large yellow onions, sliced and separated into rings
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup cooking sherry
- 7 cups reduced-sodium beef broth
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- 8  slices of French bread
- ½ cup shredded Gruyere cheese
- ⅓ cup shredded Emmental cheese
- ¼ cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle onions with sugar; reduce heat to medium. Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Stir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food. Transfer onions into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth. Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf. Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.
3. Preheat the oven broiler about 10 minutes before serving. Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source.
4. Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet; broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
5. Lightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl. Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl. Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.
6. Place filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.
