## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules
- 1 cup multi-colored quinoa
- 2 cups roughly chopped spinach
- 3 tablespoons almond oil
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons champagne vinegar
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- 3  on-the-vine tomatoes (such as Campari®), diced

## Instructions

1. Bring water and bouillon to a boil in a saucepan. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Transfer quinoa to a bowl and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir spinach into quinoa and refrigerate until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes.
2. Whisk almond oil, olive oil, vinegar, thyme, basil, garlic, and salt together in a bowl until dressing is smooth.
