## Instructions

1. Blend tahini, rice vinegar, soy sauce, 2 tablespoons olive oil, chile-garlic sauce, turmeric, and 2 tablespoons water together in a large bowl with a fork.

10. Cook and stir garlic in the olive oil until fragrant, about 1 minute.
11. Stir ginger and drained seaweed with the garlic; cook and stir 1 minute more.
12. Add kale to the skillet; cook and stir until the kale is coated slightly, about 1 minute more.
13. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer together until the kale wilts, 5 to 10 minutes.
