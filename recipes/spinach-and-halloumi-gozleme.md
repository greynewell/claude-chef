## Ingredients

- 11 ounces Greek yogurt
- 1 pinch salt
- 3 cups self-rising flour
- 1 drizzle extra-virgin olive oil
- ¾ (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 9 ounces grated halloumi cheese
- 2 medium scallions, finely chopped
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 tablespoon salted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium lemon, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Place yogurt in a large bowl and stir in salt. Gradually add flour, a few tablespoons at a time, until you have a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead with your hands until soft and slightly tacky. Place the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover with a clean tea towel, and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, warm a frying pan over medium heat. Add a drizzle of oil, then add spinach, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir, about 5 minutes. Take off of the heat and allow to cool, about 10 minutes. Stir in halloumi, scallions, and Italian seasoning.
3. Divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Roll out each ball into a 10- to 12-inch circle on a floured surface. Place some spinach filling on one side of each circle and fold the dough over. Seal the edges with a fork.
4. Heat a large frying pan over medium-low heat. Combine melted butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a bowl, and brush onto both sides of the gozleme. Cook each gozleme in the hot pan until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
5. Cut each gozleme into 4 slices and finish with several squeezes of lemon juice.
