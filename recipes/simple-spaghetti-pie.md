## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
- 2 cups cracker crumbs
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion, divided
- 1 tablespoon garlic salt, divided
- 1 ½ sticks butter, melted
- 2 cups milk
- 4  eggs

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
3. Layer 1/2 the cooked spaghetti into the bottom of the prepared pan. Sprinkle 1/2 the cracker crumbs, 1/2 the Parmesan cheese, 1/2 the parsley, 1/2 the minced onion, and 1/2 the garlic salt on top. Pour in 1/2 of the melted butter. Repeat with remaining spaghetti, cracker crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, minced onion, garlic salt, and butter.
4. Mix milk and eggs together in a bowl. Pour over the spaghetti mixture.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 30 minutes. Cut pie in squares.
