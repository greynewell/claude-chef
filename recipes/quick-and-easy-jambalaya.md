## Ingredients

- 8 ounces smoked sausage, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1  celery stalk, diced
- 1  yellow bell pepper, diced
- ½  onion, diced
- 1 (10 ounce) can chunk chicken breast, drained and flaked
- 1 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 1 (16 ounce) can chicken broth
- 1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 cups instant brown rice

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil sausage until hot, 8 to 12 minutes; drain.
2. Heat canola oil in a pot over medium-high heat; saute sausage, celery, bell pepper, and onion in hot oil until vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes.
