## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon cooking oil
- ¾ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 cups chopped broccoli
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup creamy peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 ½ cups warm cooked rice
- 6 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Toss in chicken, sesame seeds, garlic salt, and pepper; cook and stir in hot oil until no longer pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Add broccoli, onion, and ginger. Cook until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine sugar, peanut butter, soy sauce, water, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook sauce, stirring frequently, until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes.
3. Assemble the wraps using the tortillas, chicken-broccoli mixture, cooked rice, and peanut sauce.
