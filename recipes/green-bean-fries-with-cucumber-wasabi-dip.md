## Ingredients

- ½ cup ranch dressing
- ¼ cup peeled, seeded, and minced cucumber
- 1 tablespoon whole milk
- 1 ½ teaspoons prepared horseradish
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Japanese wasabi powder
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 8 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon whole milk, or more as needed
- ½ cup plain bread crumbs
- ½ cup crushed French-fried onions
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 8 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Blend ranch dressing, cucumber, 1 tablespoon milk, horseradish, vinegar, wasabi powder, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper together in a food processor until dip is smooth. Transfer dip to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes.
2. Bring water and chicken broth to a boil; add green beans and cook until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Drain.
3. Whisk egg and 1 tablespoon milk together in a bowl. Combine bread crumbs, French-fried onions, 3/4 teaspoon salt, onion powder, black pepper, and garlic powder together in a separate bowl. Place flour in a third bowl.
4. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Press green beans in flour until evenly coated. Dip coated green beans in egg-milk mixture, allowing excess liquid to drip back into bowl. Transfer green beans to bread crumbs mixture and press to coat, shaking off excess. Arrange coated beans in 1 layer on a plate or in a colander.
6. Working in batches, fry coated green beans in the hot oil until crisp, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Transfer green bean fries to a paper towel-lined colander using a slotted spoon. Serve green bean fries with dip.
