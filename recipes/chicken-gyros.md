## Instructions

1. Cut chicken into large cubes. Soak bamboo skewers in water.
2. Whisk lemon juice, olive oil, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper for marinade together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.
3. Mix yogurt, cucumber, garlic, olive oil, dill, vinegar, and salt for tzatziki together in a small bowl. Place in the refrigerator to marinate the flavors until chicken and vegetables are cooked.
4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with foil.
5. Toss onion, bell pepper, olive oil, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder for veggies together in a large bowl. Pour onto one of the prepared baking sheets.
6. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Skewer chicken and place on the remaining baking sheet. Discard the remaining marinade.
7. Place chicken in the preheated oven on the middle rack, and veggies on the bottom rack. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove veggies. Turn on the broiler and broil chicken until browned, about 2 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
8. Remove chicken from the oven. Pull off skewers and place in pitas. Top with cooked veggies, tzatziki, and Sriracha.
