- 5 medium Tomatoes, red, ripe, raw
- 2 cups chicken stock
- ½ medium white onion, sliced
- 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and sliced
- 2 small jalapeno peppers, seeded and sliced

## Instructions

1. Combine chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cumin, allspice, salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl. Add shrimp and toss to combine with the spices. Set aside for at least 1 hour.
2. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Melt butter in a pot over medium heat and cook diced onion until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 3 tomatoes and cook until beginning to break down, about 20 minutes.
3. Pour in chicken stock and puree using an immersion blender. Add remaining tomatoes, sliced onion, bell pepper, jalapenos, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Simmer sauce on medium-low for 45 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, rinse rice in a mesh strainer. Run strainer under a faucet until the water runs clear. Shake the water off and let rice dry for 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Pour a thin layer of vegetable oil in another pot and heat over medium heat. Add rice and lightly fry for 4 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and lime zest and cook for 1 minute. Strain oil out of the rice and return to the pot.
6. Add water, 1 tablespoon lime juice, and salt to the pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice has absorbed most of the liquid, about 20 minutes. Toss with remaining lime juice and cilantro.
7. Melt butter in a separate pot and add shrimp. Saute shrimp until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.
8. Scoop some rice on a plate, ladle tomato sauce over it, and top with shrimp. Serve immediately.
