## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning
- 5 slices pepper Jack cheese
- 5 roll (blank)s hamburger buns, split
- ¼ cup sour cream, or to taste
- ¼ cup salsa, or to taste
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1  tomato, sliced
- 1  avocado, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Mix ground beef and taco seasoning together in a bowl with your hands. Separate mixture into 5 equal portions. Form into patties.
