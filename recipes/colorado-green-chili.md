## Ingredients

- 1 pound Hatch chile peppers
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 5 cups vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons chili powder, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; spread Hatch chile peppers on top.
3. Cook under the preheated broiler, turning once, until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and seal tightly with plastic wrap. Let cool, about 20 minutes. Peel and seed peppers; dice flesh.
4. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in diced chile peppers and tomatoes. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour into the pot.
5. Pour broth into the pot; add cumin, chili powder, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes.
