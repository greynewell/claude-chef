## Ingredients

- 1 pound chicken tenders
- ½ tablespoon olive oil
- 1  shallot, diced
- 2 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- ¼ cup ranch dressing
- ⅛ cup Buffalo sauce
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ½ (1 inch) cube shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- ½ cup shredded Gouda cheese
- 8 (6 inch) tortillas, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Place chicken tenders into a medium-sized pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer until chicken tenders are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain chicken tenders. Transfer to a cutting board and cut or shred as desired.
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook shallot until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Combine cream cheese, ranch dressing, Buffalo sauce, and cooked shallots in a bowl; mix until creamy. Add cooked chicken and season with salt and pepper.
4. Spread Buffalo chicken mixture onto a tortilla and top with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and Gouda cheese. Cover with a second tortilla and set quesadilla aside. Repeat with remaining tortillas, chicken mixture, and cheese.
5. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 quesadilla and cook until browned on 1 side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until tortilla is crisp and cheese is melted, about 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining quesadillas.
