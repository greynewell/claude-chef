## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 2  onions, roughly chopped, divided
- 4  carrots, cut into 1/2-inch rounds
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ¼ teaspoon Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Pour in enough olive oil into a large stockpot to coat the bottom; add 1 onion, carrots, garlic, red pepper flakes, Greek seasoning, rosemary, thyme, basil, Italian seasoning, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.
