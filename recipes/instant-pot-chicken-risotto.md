## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, chopped
- 3 tablespoons butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup diced onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups Arborio rice
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 4 ½ cups chicken stock
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 sprig fresh parsley, chopped

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®), and select Saute function on normal setting according to manufacturer's instructions.
2. Mix oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Season chicken with spice blend.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in the pressure cooker until butter is melted. Quickly brown chicken on all sides, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove onion and garlic from the pot.
4. Melt a second tablespoon of butter in the pot, add rice, and stir constantly until fully coated and toasted, about 3 minutes. Pour in wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon. Cook until wine is absorbed and alcohol cooks off, about 2 minutes. Add chicken stock, chicken, and onion mixture to the pot; mix until well combined. Turn off Saute function.
5. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions, and set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
6. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir Parmesan cheese and remaining tablespoon of butter into the risotto. Season with salt and pepper, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve.
