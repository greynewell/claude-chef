## Ingredients

- 1 pound Italian hot sausage links
- ½ cup finely sliced green onions
- ¼ cup diced onions
- ½ cup finely chopped carrots
- ½ cup finely chopped water chestnuts
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 16  spring roll wrappers
- avocado oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Remove casing from sausage and cook in a skillet over medium heat until slightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add green onions, carrots, water chestnuts, and onion. Cook and stir until onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Season with soy sauce, salt, and ginger. Stir until filling is well combined; remove from heat.
2. Lay a spring roll wrapper at an angle. Place a scant 1/4 cup filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold bottom corner over filling and tuck in the sides to form a roll. Use your finger to lightly moisten edges with water. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Mist each roll with avocado oil cooking spray.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C).
4. Place lumpia rolls in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; cook in batches if necessary. Fry for 4 minutes; flip and cook until skins are crispy, about 4 minutes more.
