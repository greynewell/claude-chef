## Ingredients

- 1 (3 1/2) pound pork butt roast
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons coriander
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ cups Heinz Tomato Ketchup
- 1 cup Heinz® Apple Cider Vinegar
- ½ cup fancy molasses
- ⅓ cup Heinz® Mustard
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- Soft rolls

## Instructions

1. Remove all string from roast and trim away excess fat.
2. Place chili powder in a bowl; blend in oil, pepper, cumin, coriander, paprika, allspice, salt, and garlic to make a paste. Rub all over pork, working spice mixture into meat well. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
3. Transfer roast to a slow cooker. Blend ketchup, vinegar, molasses, and mustard. Pour mixture over roast.
4. Cook on Low until very tender, 8 to 10 hours.
5. Transfer roast to a large bowl; discard any visible fat. Use two forks to separate meat into long strands. Return shredded meat to the slow cooker; stir to combine with remaining cooking juices.
6. Remove 1 1/2 cups cooking juices and strain into a saucepan. Whisk in cornstarch and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until thickened and bubbling. Serve meat on soft rolls; drizzle with thickened sauce to taste.
