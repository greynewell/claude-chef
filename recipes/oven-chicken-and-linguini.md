## Ingredients

- ½ cup butter
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons dried basil
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 pounds chicken thighs
- 1 pound linguine pasta
- 2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Place butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish and set in oven while it preheats until butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir onion, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into melted butter. Add chicken, turning to coat with onion mixture and ending skin-side up.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from dish.
5. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
6. Mix spinach into onion-butter sauce until thoroughly mixed; add linguine and Parmesan cheese, tossing to combine. Place chicken on top of pasta.
