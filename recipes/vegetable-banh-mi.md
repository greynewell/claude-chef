## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup matchstick-cut carrots
- ⅓ cup matchstick-cut jicama
- ¼ cup thinly sliced onion
- ¾ cup rice vinegar, divided
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sriracha sauce, or more to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  portobello mushrooms - stems and gills removed, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2  hoagie rolls, split lengthwise and toasted
- ¼ cup thinly sliced cucumber
- 1  jalapeno pepper, sliced, or to taste  (Optional)

- 2  lime wedges

## Instructions

1. Combine carrots, jicama, and onion in a small bowl.
2. Combine 1/2 cup vinegar, water, and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and pour pickling liquid over the sliced vegetables. Let sit for 30 minutes.
3. Whisk remaining 1/4 cup vinegar with fish sauce, soy sauce, sriracha sauce, garlic powder, five-spice powder, salt, and pepper in a 10-inch saute pan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, about 3 minutes. Add portobello mushrooms; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms from the liquid with a slotted spoon.
4. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise over each roll half. Place 1/2 the cooked mushrooms over bottom halves. Drain pickled vegetables and place over the mushrooms. Divide cucumber, jalapeno, and cilantro between the sandwiches. Add more sriracha if desired. Squeeze 1 lime wedge over the filling of each sandwich and cover with top bun half.
