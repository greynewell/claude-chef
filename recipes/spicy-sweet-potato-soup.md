## Ingredients

- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon grated lime zest
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1  onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 4 cups chicken stock
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
- ¼ cup smooth peanut butter
- 1  lime, juiced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- salt to taste
- 1 large roma (plum) tomato, seeded and diced

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and lime zest. Set aside in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to blend.
2. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add sweet potatoes, and chicken stock. Season with cumin, chili flakes and ginger. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender.
3. Puree the soup using an immersion blender or regular blender. If using a counter top blender, puree in small batches, filling the blender just a bit past half way to avoid spillage. Whisk peanut butter into the soup, and heat through. Stir in lime juice, and salt.
4. Ladle into warm bowls, and top with a dollop of the reserved sour cream, a few pieces of diced tomato, and a sprinkle of cilantro.
