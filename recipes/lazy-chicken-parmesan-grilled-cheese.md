## Ingredients

- 2  frozen breaded chicken patties (such as Tyson®)
- 2 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste
- 4 slices Italian bread
- 1 cup marinara sauce
- ½ teaspoon dried basil, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
- 6 thin slices  provolone cheese
- 2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place chicken patties on a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and crispy, about 20 minutes. Cut chicken patties in half lengthwise.
3. Spread garlic butter onto 1 side of each bread slice.
4. Mix marinara sauce, basil, and garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until warmed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir.
5. Place 1 bread slice, butter-side down, into a skillet; top with 2 slices provolone cheese, 1 tablespoon marinara sauce, 2 chicken patty halves, overlapped to cover bread, 2 tablespoons marinara sauce, 1 slice provolone cheese, and bread, butter-side up. Cook over medium heat until bread is crisp and cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
6. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over remaining marinara sauce and serve alongside each sandwich.
