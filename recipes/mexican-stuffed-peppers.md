## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ¾ cup water
- 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup white rice
- 1 cup water
- 1 ½ cups chunky salsa
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3 large green bell peppers, tops and seeds removed
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 1 (14.5 ounce) package nacho cheese-flavored tortilla chips (such as Doritos®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir 3/4 cup water and taco seasoning into ground beef; simmer until water has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir rice in the hot oil until fragrant and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water, salsa, onion, and garlic; bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover skillet, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir ground beef mixture into rice mixture.
4. Spoon a layer of ground beef-rice mixture into each bell pepper; top with a layer of Mexican cheese and a layer of nacho cheese-flavored tortilla chips. Repeat layering ingredients into bell peppers, ending with a Mexican cheese layer. Arrange stuffed peppers in a 9x9-inch baking dish.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bell peppers are tender and cheese is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
