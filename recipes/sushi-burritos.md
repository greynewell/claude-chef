## Ingredients

- 2 cups cold cooked sushi rice
- 1 ½ tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 sheets toasted nori (dry seaweed)
- 3 tablespoons sriracha mayonnaise
- ½ small avocado, thinly sliced
- 1  cucumber, cut into matchsticks
- ¼ cup matchstick carrots
- 2 tablespoons radish matchsticks
- 1 ounce smoked salmon, thinly sliced
- 1 ounce cream cheese

## Instructions

1. Place sushi rice in a medium bowl. Combine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir until sugar and salt have dissolved, about 1 minute. Pour vinegar mixture over sushi rice and mix to combine. Set aside.
2. Place each nori sheet onto a piece of parchment paper on a clean work surface. Top each sheet with 1 cup sushi rice, pressing to create an even layer, leaving 1 inch exposed at the bottom of the sheet and 1/2 inch exposed on the sides and top. Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise lengthwise down the middle of the rice. Top each with 1/4 cup avocado slices, 1/4 cup cucumber, 2 tablespoons carrot, 1 tablespoon radish, 1/2 ounce smoked salmon slices, and 1/2 ounce cream cheese. Make sure all ingredients run down the length of the mayonnaise in the center of each burrito.
3. Wet fingers with a little bit of water and spread on the bottom of each nori sheet. Using parchment paper, tightly roll the bottom of each nori sheet up over salmon, cream cheese, and vegetables, and continue rolling until completely sealed. Use parchment paper to press and ensure roll is tight. Discard parchment paper and slice sushi burritos in half on a diagonal. Serve immediately.
