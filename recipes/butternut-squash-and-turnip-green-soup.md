## Ingredients

- 1 small butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 1 (32 ounce) carton reduced-sodium chicken broth
- 1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 2 ½ cups water
- 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (15.8 ounce) can great northern beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 bunch turnip greens
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ¾ teaspoon Creole seasoning
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 (12 ounce) packages Cajun-style andouille sausage, sliced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chicken broth
- 1 (1.4 ounce) package vegetable soup mix (such as Knorr®)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine butternut squash, reduced-sodium chicken broth, diced tomatoes, water, black beans, great northern beans, turnip greens, 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, sugar, Creole seasoning, garlic powder, and salt in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil.
2. Meanwhile, heat remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage and onion in the hot skillet until sausage is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add regular chicken broth and scrape up all the browned bits on the bottom of the skillet. Pour the mixture into the soup pot.
3. Reduce heat and simmer soup until squash and greens are tender, about 45 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
