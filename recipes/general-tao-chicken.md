## Ingredients

- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 2  eggs
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger root
- ½ cup chopped green onion
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- ¼ cup oyster sauce
- ¼ cup ketchup

## Instructions

1. Coat chicken pieces with cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.
2. Beat eggs, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl until combined. Stir in flour and baking powder until no large lumps remain. Mix in chicken pieces until evenly coated.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink on the inside, about 12 minutes. Set chicken aside; keep warm.
4. Make sauce: Reduce heat to medium-high; add green onion, ginger, and sesame oil to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion is limp and ginger begins to brown, about 1 minute. Pour in water, sugar, and vinegar; bring to a boil.
5. Dissolve cornstarch in soy sauce in a small bowl and stir into vinegar mixture along with oyster sauce and ketchup. Cook until sauce has thickened and is no longer cloudy. Stir in chicken; simmer until heated through.
