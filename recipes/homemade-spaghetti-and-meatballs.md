## Ingredients

- 1 (29 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
- 19 fluid ounces tomato juice
- 1 (5.5 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef

- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine tomatoes, tomato juice, tomato paste, onion, parsley, salt, red pepper flakes, black pepper, thyme, and cloves in a large pot. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
3. Meanwhile, combine beef, crackers, eggs, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, and thyme in a bowl. Form into large meatballs and place into a broiler pan.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes.
5. Transfer meatballs to sauce and continue to simmer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more.
6. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
7. Serve sauce and meatballs over cooked spaghetti.
