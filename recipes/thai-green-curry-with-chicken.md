## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons peanut oil
- ¼ cup Thai green curry paste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (1/4 inch thick) slice ginger, finely grated
- 2  boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced
- 1 (15 ounce) can baby corn pieces, drained
- 1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained
- 2 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons palm sugar
- 6  kaffir lime leaves
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
- 1  orange bell pepper, cut into thin strips
- ¼ cup thinly sliced Thai basil, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic, and ginger; stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. Cook until just slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
2. While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small saucepan, cover with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil. Drain then cover with water again.
3. Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo shoots and add in. Stir in fish sauce, palm sugar, and lime leaves. Bring back up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in bell pepper strips and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
4. Remove curry from heat and stir in Thai basil.
