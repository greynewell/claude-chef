## Ingredients

- 12 ounces spaghetti
- 1 cup chopped onions
- 1 cup chopped green bell peppers
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 (16 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 cups shredded mild Cheddar cheese
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
- ¼ cup water
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, and set aside.
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the onions, green peppers and ground beef. Once beef is brown and onions and peppers softened, add the tomatoes, mushrooms and oregano. Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.

Sprinkle with 1 cup of the mild Cheddar cheese. Repeat. In a medium bowl, mix together cream of mushroom soup and water until smooth; pour over casserole. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
