## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ cup whole wheat bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon lemon zest
- 1 (15 ounce) can canned beans
- 1 (5 ounce) can tuna, drained
- 2 cups tomato sauce
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Stir in the pasta and boil until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Toast bread crumbs in oil, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; stir in lemon zest. Remove seasoned bread crumbs from skillet and drain on paper towels.
4. Place the skillet back over medium heat. Add the beans, and mash. Stir in the tuna, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Toss sauce with prepared pasta; place in prepared baking dish. Top with the toasted bread crumbs and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 10 minutes.
