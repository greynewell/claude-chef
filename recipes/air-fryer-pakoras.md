## Ingredients

- 2 cups chopped cauliflower
- 1 cup diced yellow potatoes
- 1 ¼ cups chickpea flour (besan)
- ¾ cup water
- ½  red onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine cauliflower, potatoes, chickpea flour, water, red onion, salt, garlic, curry powder, coriander, cayenne, and cumin in a large bowl. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.
