## Ingredients

- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 4 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 3 slices fresh ginger root
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on medium power for 1 minute, then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds, watching closely to prevent boiling.
2. Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over top and set aside to marinate for 15 minutes.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Meanwhile, remove chicken from marinade; transfer marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until thick, about 1 minute. Set aside for basting.
5. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until golden brown on all sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
