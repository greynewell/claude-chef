## Ingredients

- 1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread
- 5 tablespoons butter, softened
- 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and pepper to taste

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Cut loaf into ten 1-inch slices.
