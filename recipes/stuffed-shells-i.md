## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells
- 4 cups large curd cottage cheese
- 12 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2  eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
3. Mix together cottage cheese, mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Rub oregano and parsley between your palms to pulverize them, then stir into cheese mixture. Stuff mixture into pasta shells.
4. Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce on the bottom of a 15x10-inch baking dish. Place shells, seam-side up, close together in the dish. Spread remaining sauce on top; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 25 to 35 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
