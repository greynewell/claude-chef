## Ingredients

- 6 ounces sliced jalapeno peppers
- 1  tomato, diced
- 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chile peppers
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 1  red bell pepper, diced

## Instructions

1. Mix jalapeno peppers, tomato, green chile peppers, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl.
2. Cook beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring to break up clumps, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease. Add jalapeno pepper mixture and burrito seasoning; cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.
3. Pour refried beans into a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes.
