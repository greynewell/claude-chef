## Ingredients

- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 ½ cups hot coffee
- 1 ¾ cups white sugar
- ½ cup Greek yogurt
- ½ cup whole milk
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¾ cup olive oil
- 2 cups unbleached flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
2. Place cocoa into a small bowl. Pour coffee over cocoa and stir to combine. Set aside to cool.
3. Combine sugar, yogurt, milk, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add olive oil and mix to combine.
4. Whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a large bowl until no lumps remain. Pour dry ingredients into wet ingredients and beat until just combined. Stir in cooled coffee mixture, then pour batter into the prepared pans.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. The centers may look slightly wet but will spring back lightly when touched.
6. Remove from the oven and cool in the pans for 15 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges of each pan to loosen, then invert cakes carefully onto a wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
