## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ cup water, or more if needed
- vegetable oil for frying
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 pinch ground white pepper
- 4  boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed

## Instructions

1. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Drizzle in sesame oil. Gradually add water, whisking constantly until smooth; batter should be the consistency of cream. Let sit for at least 30 minutes.
2. Fill a deep pan or wok with oil and slowly heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Mix cornstarch and white pepper together in a large shallow dish. Dust chicken in the cornstarch mixture and dip into the batter, evenly coating each piece. Transfer to the hot oil in batches and fry until golden and no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes. Scoop fried chicken out with a slotted spoon. Drain on a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining chicken.
