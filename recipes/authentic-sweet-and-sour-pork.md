## Ingredients

- 8 ounces pork loin
- 1 teaspoon rice wine
- ⅔ teaspoon salt, divided
- 1 pinch monosodium glutamate (MSG)
- ½ cup chicken stock
- ¼ cup cornstarch, divided
- 2 ½ tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- ⅔ teaspoon soy sauce
- 2  eggs
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable oil for frying
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (3/4 inch thick) slice ginger, minced
- 4  spring onions, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Pound pork to 1/3-inch thickness using a meat mallet. Slice into 1 1/2-inch strips.
2. Combine pork strips, rice wine, 1/3 teaspoon salt, and monosodium glutamate in a bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
3. Mix remaining 1/3 teaspoon salt, chicken stock, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in a bowl to make sauce.
4. Beat eggs with remaining 3 tablespoons cornstarch in a bowl until smooth. Add pork strips; stir to coat.
5. Heat oil in a wok or large saucepan to 280 degrees F (140 degrees C). Add pork strips one at a time to the hot oil. Cook until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate with a slotted spoon.
6. Heat oil to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C). Return pork to the hot oil. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate with the slotted spoon.
7. Drain all but 2 tablespoons oil from the wok. Cook and stir garlic and ginger in the hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add sauce and spring onions; cook and stir until sauce begins to thicken, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour sauce over the pork on the serving plate.
