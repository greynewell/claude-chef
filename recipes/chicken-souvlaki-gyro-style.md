## Ingredients

- ¾ cup balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ½ cup seeded, shredded cucumber
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ½ tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- ½ teaspoon Greek seasoning
- kosher salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 large pita bread rounds
- 1  heart of romaine lettuce, cut into 1/4 inch slices
- 1  red onion, thinly sliced
- 1  tomato, halved and sliced
- ½ cup kalamata olives
- ½ cup pepperoncini
- 1 cup crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix balsamic vinaigrette, juice from 1/2 lemon, oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over chicken, seal, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.
3. Toss shredded cucumber with 1 teaspoon kosher salt; set aside for at least 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, mix yogurt, sour cream, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, rice vinegar, and olive oil. Season with garlic, fresh dill, and Greek seasoning. Squeeze cucumber to remove any excess water; stir into sauce. Season to taste with kosher salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to use.
4. Remove chicken from marinade and place on the preheated grill. Discard remaining marinade. Cook chicken until juices run clear, about 8 minutes on each side. Remove chicken from heat, and allow to sit about 10 minutes before slicing into thin strips.
5. Place pita rounds on the grill, and cook for about 2 minutes, until warm, turning frequently to avoid burning. Arrange warmed pita, sliced chicken, lettuce, onion, tomato, olives, and pepperoncini on a serving platter. Serve tzatziki sauce and feta cheese in separate bowls on the side. Stuff pita pockets with chicken and toppings to serve.
