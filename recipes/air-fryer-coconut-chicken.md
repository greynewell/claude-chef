## Ingredients

- ½ cup canned coconut milk
- ½ cup pineapple juice
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons Sriracha sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- nonstick cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Place coconut milk, pineapple juice, brown sugar, soy sauce, Sriracha sauce, and ginger in a medium sized bowl and whisk to combine. Add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Whisk eggs in a bowl. Combine shredded coconut, panko, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.
4. Remove chicken strips from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Dip chicken strips in beaten egg, then in coconut-panko mixture, then again in egg mixture, and again in coconut-panko mixture, double dipping and double coating each strip.
5. Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray.
6. Place breaded chicken strips in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching; work in batches if necessary.
