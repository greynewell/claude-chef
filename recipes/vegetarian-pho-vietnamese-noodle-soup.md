## Ingredients

- 10 cups vegetable stock
- 1  onion, peeled and halved
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 8 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
- 2 (3 inch) cinnamon sticks
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 2 pods star anise
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 (16 ounce) package thin rice noodles (such as Thai Kitchen®)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed
- 2 (14 ounce) packages firm tofu, drained and cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 8 ounces enoki mushrooms
- 4  scallions, thinly sliced
- ½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro
- 1  lime, cut into wedges
- 2  jalapeno peppers, sliced into rings
- ¼ cup mung bean sprouts
- ¼ cup Thai basil leaves, torn into bite-size pieces

## Instructions

1. Place vegetable stock, onion, soy sauce, garlic, cinnamon sticks, ground ginger, star anise, and bay leaves in a large pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove solids with a slotted spoon and keep broth hot.
2. Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside until noodles are softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse thoroughly. Divide noodles among 6 serving bowls.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tofu in a single layer and fry, in batches, until golden brown, about 6 minutes per side.
4. Simmer fried tofu and mushrooms in broth until heated through, about 5 minutes. Transfer to serving bowls. Top with scallions and cilantro. Ladle in hot broth.
5. Serve lime wedges, jalapeno peppers, bean sprouts, and basil alongside for garnishing each bowl.
