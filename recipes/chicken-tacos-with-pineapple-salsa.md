## Ingredients

- 1 cup tomatoes, seeded and diced
- 1 medium red onion, diced, divided
- 1 cup diced fresh pineapple
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips
- 1  lime, juiced
- 8 (7 inch) tortillas, or more as needed
- 1 cup shredded lettuce
- 8 dashes Sriracha sauce, or more to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine tomatoes, 1/2 cup diced red onion, pineapple, and cilantro in a medium bowl. Add 1 tablespoon lime juice, salt, and sugar; toss to combine. Cover salsa with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
2. Place the remaining red onion in the bowl of a small food processor. Add juice of one lime and process until finely ground, about 3 minutes.
3. Place chicken strips into a shallow dish. Slather onion mixture over the chicken, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill to high heat, about 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil the grill.
5. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate.
6. Lightly brown the tortillas on the grill for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drain the salsa.
7. Thinly slice the chicken, against the grain. Lay tortillas out on plates, top with lettuce, chicken, pineapple salsa, and Sriracha sauce.
