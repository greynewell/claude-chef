## Ingredients

- 4 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick across bones)
- ½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons Asian plum wine

## Instructions

1. Wash the ribs, removing any stray bits of bone, and allow to drain for 30 minutes.
2. Whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, honey, garlic, pepper, water, sesame oil, and plum wine until the sugar has dissolved; pour the mixture into a 1 gallon plastic zipper bag. Place the ribs into the marinade, squeeze all the air out of the bag, zip it up, and refrigerate at least 24 hours.
3. The next day, remove the ribs from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature before grilling. Remove the ribs from the marinade and discard the marinade.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Grill the ribs until browned and no longer pink inside, 4 to 6 minutes per side.
