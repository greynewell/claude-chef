## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat penne pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  zucchinis, diced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- 2  carrots, diced
- 1 (8 ounce) package mushrooms, sliced
- 3  onions, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- ⅔ cup shredded smoked Gouda cheese

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the zucchini, bell pepper, carrots, mushrooms, and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more. Stir in the tomatoes, chicken broth, parsley, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce thickens. Stir in the pasta and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Top with Parmesan and Gouda cheeses before serving.
