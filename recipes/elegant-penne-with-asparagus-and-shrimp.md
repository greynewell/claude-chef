## Ingredients

- 1 cup penne pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup onion, chopped
- ½ cup white wine
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 10 spears asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 18  peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 25 per lb)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
