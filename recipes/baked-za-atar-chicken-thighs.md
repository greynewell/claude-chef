## Ingredients

- 4  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3 tablespoons za'atar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, mix together the za'atar, salt, and olive oil until the consistency of a thick paste. Add chicken thighs to the bowl, and toss to coat liberally on all sides. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
