## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  anchovy fillet
- 2 tablespoons capers
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 3 cups crushed Italian (plum) tomatoes (such as San Marzano)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 (7 ounce) can oil-packed tuna, drained
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
- 1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir anchovy and capers in hot oil until anchovy crumbles, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Pour white wine, oregano, and red pepper flakes into the skillet and increase heat to high; cook until mixture reduces and about 3 tablespoons of liquid remain, 2 to 4 minutes.
3. Stir tomatoes into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Season tomato mixture with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.
4. Stir tuna and 1/4 cup parsley into tomato sauce, breaking up tuna with a wooden spoon while stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes.
5. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and still slightly firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain and transfer spaghetti back to the pot.
6. Pour tomato sauce over spaghetti into the pot; stir to combine, cover the pot with a lid, and let sit until spaghetti is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Ladle spaghetti into bowls, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and parsley over the top.
