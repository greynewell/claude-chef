## Ingredients

- ¾ cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Mix mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs in a separate bowl. Dip each chicken breast into the mayonnaise mixture, then into the bread crumbs to coat. Arrange breaded chicken on a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the coating is golden brown, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
