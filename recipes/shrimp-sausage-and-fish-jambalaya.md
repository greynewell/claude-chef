- 1 cup diced green bell pepper
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce (such as Lea & Perrins®)
- 1 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's), or to taste

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Cook andouille sausage in the melted butter until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel.
2. Cook and stir onion, celery, and green bell pepper in the butter remaining in the pot until the onion becomes translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir garlic into the onion mixture; cook and stir together for 1 minute.
4. Stir tomato paste through the vegetable mixture; cook and stir another 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Return andouille sausage to the pot along with diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and black pepper; stir to combine.
6. Pour chicken broth over the sausage mixture; bring to a boil.
7. Stir rice into the mixture, place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook undisturbed until the rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
8. Add shrimp and cod to the rice mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the mixture comes to a boil; reduce heat again to medium-low and cook uncovered another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
9. Season with salt and fold parsley into the jambalaya to serve.
