## Ingredients

- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
- 6  wooden skewers
- 2 large green or red bell peppers, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 large onion, quartered and separated into pieces
- 12  cherry tomatoes
- 12  fresh mushrooms

## Instructions

1. Whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, cumin, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
2. Meanwhile, soak wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before use.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess liquid; discard remaining marinade. Alternately thread chicken with bell peppers, onion, tomatoes, and mushrooms onto the skewers.
5. Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning frequently, until nicely browned on all sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
