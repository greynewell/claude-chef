## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 2  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon ancho chile powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon chipotle pepper powder
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon fine cornmeal
- 2 cups chicken broth, divided
- 2 (15 ounce) cans white beans, drained
- 1 cup chicken broth
- ¼ teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ⅓ cup chopped green onions
- ⅓ cup sour cream
- ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until browned, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, flip breasts, cover the pan, and cook until browned on the other side, about 5 minutes. Remove to a plate and allow to cool before chopping into cubes.
2. Return skillet to medium heat, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, onion, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until onion turns translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3. Stir ancho chili powder, cumin, flour, chipotle pepper powder, and oregano into the onion mixture; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup of the chicken broth and stir, scraping up any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Stir in cornmeal and bring to a simmer.
4. Stir in beans and 1 more cup chicken broth. Cut cooled chicken breasts into cubes, add to the chili and bring to a simmer. Add remaining cup of chicken broth, season with salt, black pepper, sugar, and cayenne pepper to taste; cook until heated through. Serve garnished with green onions, sour cream, and cilantro.
