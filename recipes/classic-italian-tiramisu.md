## Ingredients

- 6 large eggs, separated, divided
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 2 (8.8 ounce) containers mascarpone cheese
- 4 tablespoons amaretto liqueur, divided
- 1 ½ cups brewed espresso, cooled
- 1 ½ (12 ounce) packages ladyfingers (about 30)
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add mascarpone cheese and 2 tablespoons amaretto. Beat well.
2. Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with clean beaters until stiff peaks form. Fold beaten egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.
3. Pour espresso and remaining 2 tablespoons amaretto into a shallow dish. Stir well. Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture and line the bottom of an 8-inch glass dish.
4. Once the bottom of the dish is covered in an even layer of espresso-soaked ladyfingers, top with 1/2 the mascarpone mixture. Repeat with another ladyfinger layer, followed by the remaining mascarpone mixture. Chill in the refrigerator for about 4 hours.
5. Dust with cocoa powder before serving.
