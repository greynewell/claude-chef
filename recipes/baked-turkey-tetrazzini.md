## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 (8 ounce) package white mushrooms, sliced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 stalks celery, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 3 ½ cups milk
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3 cups cubed leftover cooked turkey
- 1 cup peas
- ½ (8 ounce) package egg noodles, or more to taste
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoons melted butter

## Instructions

1. Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and celery until tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour over mushroom mixture and stir to coat.
2. Mix milk, cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and nutmeg into mushroom mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese is melted and sauce is warmed, 5 to 10 minutes. Add turkey and peas to sauce.

5. Combine Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and 3 tablespoons melted butter together in a bowl until crumbly; sprinkle over noodle mixture.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
