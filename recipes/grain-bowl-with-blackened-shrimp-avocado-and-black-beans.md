3. Heat oil in a medium cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side.
4. Mix corn, red bell pepper, cilantro, lime juice, and olive oil together in a bowl to make corn salad.
5. Combine avocado, cilantro, yogurt, garlic, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until dressing is smooth.
