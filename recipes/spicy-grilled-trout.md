- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon spicy Hungarian paprika
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pinch salt
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Cut several diagonal slashes with a sharp knife in each side of trout.
2. Mix lemon juice, vegetable oil, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt into a paste in a small bowl; apply to the sides of the fish, spreading it into the slashes.
3. Refrigerate trout for 1 hour.
