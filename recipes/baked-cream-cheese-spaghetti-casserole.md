## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package spaghetti
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 pinch garlic salt
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat and stir in spaghetti sauce.
4. Drain spaghetti and place in a bowl. Add cream cheese, garlic, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt. Stir until cream cheese is melted and spaghetti is thoroughly coated. Spread a small amount of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking pan; put spaghetti on top and top with remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 30 minutes.
