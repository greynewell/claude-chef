## Ingredients

- 6 (2 ounce) frozen breaded fish fillets
- 8 leaves romaine lettuce
- 2  tomatoes, cut into small wedges
- 1  avocado, diced
- ½  cucumber, sliced
- 2 slices jicama, diced, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon minced onion
- ¼ cup creamy cilantro salad dressing
- 2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese
- 6 sprigs cilantro, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place fish fillets in a single layer on a shallow metal baking pan.
2. Bake in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until crispy and browned, 22 to 24 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up excess oil. Let cool for 5 minutes.
