## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- lemon, zested
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
- 1 teaspoon fresh oregano
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup olive oil, plus more for pan
- 4  zucchini squash, cut into 'noodles' using a spiral slicer or vegetable peeler

## Instructions

1. Place chicken, garlic, lemon zest, chives, thyme, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/4 cup olive oil in a resealable plastic bag; toss to coat chicken and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to overnight.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken with marinade until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, about 8 minutes.
