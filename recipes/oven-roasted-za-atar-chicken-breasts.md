## Ingredients

- 4  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons za'atar seasoning, divided
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- cooking spray
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Pound chicken breasts to a 1-inch thickness for even cooking. Place in a large resealable plastic bag.
2. Combine 2 tablespoons za'atar seasoning, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic in a small bowl. Pour mixture over the chicken and toss to coat evenly. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 2 to 8 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
4. Place chicken breasts on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with remaining za'atar seasoning.
5. Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 23 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with salt.
