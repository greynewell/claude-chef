## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups uncooked jasmine rice
- 3 ½ cups water
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
- 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ cup fresh ginger, cut into matchsticks
- 1 large red bell pepper, cut into strips
- ¾ cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- 4  green onions cut into 2-inch pieces
- ½ teaspoon Thai red chile paste, or to taste
