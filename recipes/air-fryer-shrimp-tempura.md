## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sherry
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon chopped scallions
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon ginger stir-in paste
- 1  egg, beaten
- ½ cup cornstarch
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup club soda
- 1 pound large shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails left on

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, sherry, rice wine vinegar, oyster sauce, scallions, sugar, lemon juice, and ginger stir-in paste together in a small bowl. Set dipping sauce aside.
2. Whisk egg, cornstarch, flour, and club soda together in a large bowl. Add shrimp and gently stir until shrimp are coated.
3. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cut a piece of parchment to fit the basket of the air fryer and set aside.
