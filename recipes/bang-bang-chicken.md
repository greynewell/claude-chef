## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup milk
- 1  egg
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- ¼ cup potato starch
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)
- oil for frying
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
- 1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together milk and egg in a bowl until smooth. Add chicken to egg wash and marinate for 15 minutes. Drain.
2. Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and ground red pepper in a bowl and transfer into a large resealable bag. Add egg-washed chicken pieces and shake until each piece is completely dredged.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. Add chicken pieces into the oil in batches, about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, so as not to drop the temperature of the oil. Fry for 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry remaining chicken pieces.
5. Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry another 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry and drain the remaining chicken. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl.
6. Stir mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang together in a small bowl. Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat.
