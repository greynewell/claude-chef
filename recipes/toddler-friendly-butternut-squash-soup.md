## Ingredients

- ½ medium butternut squash
- ½ medium onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup half-and-half, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and pour in 1/4 cup water.
2. Cut butternut squash in half; scoop out and discard seeds. Place squash halves, cut-sides down, on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until squash is soft when poked with a fork, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and set aside until cool enough to handle. Scoop flesh out into a bowl and discard skins.
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; saute until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add chicken stock, butternut squash, curry powder, cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper.
5. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Bring to a simmer and cook until warm, about 10 minutes. Stir in half-and-half before serving.
