## Ingredients

- 3 medium garlic cloves, minced
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- ¾ teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 1 pound penne pasta
- 8 ounces broccoli florets
- 1 pound rare deli roast beef, sliced 1/8 inch thick and cut into bite-size strips
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
- 1 medium red bell pepper, cut into bite-size strips
- 2 cups bean sprouts
- 3  green onions, thinly sliced
- ½ cup chopped roasted (or honey-roasted) peanuts
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Mix garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, sesame oil, ginger, and pepper flakes in a 2-cup Pyrex measuring cup. Whisk in mayonnaise until smooth, then in a slow steady stream, whisk in oil to make an emulsified dressing; keep chilled until ready to toss with salad. Store in a clean jar with lid.
2. Bring 1 gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add pasta and, using package times as a guide, boil, stirring frequently and adding broccoli the last 1 minute, until just tender. Drain thoroughly (do not rinse) and dump onto a large, lipped cookie sheet. Set aside while preparing remaining salad ingredients.
3. Place all salad ingredients (except soy-ginger dressing) in a large bowl or transfer to a gallon-size zipper bag. (Can be covered and refrigerated several hours at this point). When ready to serve, add dressing; toss to coat and serve.
