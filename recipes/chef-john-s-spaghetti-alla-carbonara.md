## Ingredients

- 4 ounces guanciale, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 2  eggs
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 6 ounces spaghetti
- 1 cup reserved pasta water
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 3 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook guanciale with olive oil and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a Dutch oven over medium-low heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
2. Whisk eggs, 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese, and 1 teaspoon ground black pepper in a bowl. Set aside.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water.
4. Pour reserved pasta water and drained spaghetti into the bacon-pepper mixture; stir to combine.
5. Slowly pour egg mixture into the pasta mixture; cook, stirring constantly until the egg mixture forms a thick sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Stir remaining 3 tablespoons Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and 3 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese into the pasta mixture and serve.
