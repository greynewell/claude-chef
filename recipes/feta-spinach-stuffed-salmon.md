## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- ½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 (4 ounce) package crumbled feta cheese, or to taste
- ⅓ cup frozen chopped spinach -  thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
- 2 stalks scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced
- 1 (3/4 pound) boneless salmon fillet
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a large baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Combine cream cheese, feta cheese, spinach, and scallions in a small mixing bowl. Mash ingredients until well blended.
3. Cut salmon fillet into 2 equal pieces. Brush the top of one piece with olive oil and place oiled side down in the prepared baking dish. Spread filling evenly over top; it will be about 3/4 inch thick. Place the second piece of salmon on the filling and brush the top with olive oil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes evenly with a fork and filling is hot, 20 to 30 minutes. The time will depend on the size and weight of salmon used; check progress at 20 minutes to determine if additional baking time is needed.
5. Remove from the oven and slice into 2 pieces to serve.
