## Ingredients

- 9 cups chicken broth
- 5  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 large red onion, quartered
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 4  green onions, chopped
- 1 large green chile pepper, seeded and chopped
- 2 large tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 6  limes, juiced
- ½  lime
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- tortilla chips, for topping

## Instructions

1. Bring the chicken broth, chicken breasts, red onion, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and thyme to a boil in a large pot; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the cooked chicken to a cutting board and shred into bite-sized strips; return to the simmering pot.
2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the green onions and green chile pepper in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir the tomatoes into the mixture and continue cooking until soft, about 5 minute more; pour the mixture into the pot with the chicken soup. Season with the salt; return the soup to a simmer. Add the lime juice and 1/2 a lime; cook another 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and remove the lime half; stir in the cilantro to serve.
