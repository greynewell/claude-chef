1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat.

4. Place cauliflower into a large microwave-safe bowl.
5. Microwave until soft and tender, about 2 minutes.
6. Remove and stir.
7. Microwave for 3 minutes.

10. Stir and microwave until cauliflower looks dry and clumped up, about 5 minutes.
11. Stir Parmesan cheese, egg, and seasoning into the cauliflower until a smooth paste forms.
12. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions; transfer to the baking sheet.
13. Pat into square 'bread' slices, about 1/2-inch thick, using your knuckles and fingers.
14. Bake in the preheated oven until slices are golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
15. Let cool for a few minutes.
16. Slide off the baking sheet carefully with a good spatula.
17. Place 1 slice of Cheddar cheese over 4 cauliflower bread slices.
18. Top carefully with the other 4.
