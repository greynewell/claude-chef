## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak
- ¼ cup fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
- 2 heads romaine lettuce
- ⅓ cup fresh mint leaves
- ⅓ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- ⅓ cup fresh Thai basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Sprinkle pepper and salt onto flank steak.
2. Cook steak on preheated grill until desired doneness is reached, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
3. Whisk lime juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, garlic, and chile-garlic sauce together in a bowl.
4. Mix romaine lettuce, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a bowl; spoon about 6 tablespoons lime juice mixture over romaine mixture. Toss to coat.
5. Cut steak into strips and place strips into remaining lime juice mixture; let sit for steak to marinate, 1 to 2 minutes. Place steak on romaine mixture.
