## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 pound Italian sausage links, casings removed
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 1  green bell pepper, diced
- ½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms, or more to taste
- 2 (8 ounce) cans pizza sauce
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as Pillsbury®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the insides of 4 ramekins.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes; drain and discard grease. Add onion, green bell pepper, and mushrooms; cook and stir until vegetables are softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pizza sauce and simmer until flavors have blended, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese into sausage mixture.
3. Spoon 1/4 of the sausage mixture into each prepared ramekin; top each with 1/4 of the remaining mozzarella cheese.
4. Roll out crescent dough; cut dough into 4 equal pieces. Cover each ramekin with a piece of crescent dough, wrapping dough around the edges to seal in filling. Arrange pot pies on a baking sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.
