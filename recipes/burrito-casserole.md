## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ½ large yellow onion, chopped
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 (16 ounce) can refried beans

- 1 (10.75 ounce) can  condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 4 ounces sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add beef and increase heat to medium-high. Cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
