## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1  orange bell pepper, cut into strips
- 1 small red onion, cut into 1-inch wedges
- salt to taste
- 1 (8.8 ounce) package halloumi cheese, cut into 8 slices
- 4 (8 inch) low-carb flour tortillas
- ½ cup hummus
- 1 cup baby spinach leaves
- ⅓ cup Kalamata olives

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and set a grill pan on top of the grate.
2. Whisk together olive oil and lemon juice in a small bowl; set aside.
3. Toss together bell pepper and onion in a small bowl. Mix in 1/2 of the oil mixture and season with salt, to taste. Transfer to the hot grill pan.
4. Cook vegetables on the preheated grill until lightly charred but still firm to the bite, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pan from the grill and allow vegetables to cool. Lower the grill temperature to medium.
5. Brush halloumi cheese slices with the remaining oil mixture. Cook on the preheated grill, flipping carefully, until grill marks appear and cheese has softened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from grill and place on an aluminum foil-covered plate to keep warm.
6. Spread the tortillas with hummus and top with spinach. Divide the peppers and onions between the tortillas, add 2 halloumi slices to each tortilla, then top with olives. Roll up and serve immediately.
