## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2  shallots, chopped
- 2 (4 ounce) fillets salmon, cut into chunks
- 1 (16 ounce) container mascarpone cheese
- ¼ teaspoon saffron  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon milk, or as needed
- 1 (8 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained

- 12  no-boil lasagna noodles

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in shallots. Cook and stir until the shallots have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add salmon and saute for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and flake salmon with a fork.
3. Combine mascarpone cheese and saffron in a bowl; stir in milk until smooth but not too runny. Mix thawed, drained spinach with lemon juice in a separate bowl.
