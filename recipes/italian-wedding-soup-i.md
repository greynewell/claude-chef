## Ingredients

- ½ pound extra-lean ground beef
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 5 ¾ cups chicken broth
- 2 cups thinly sliced escarole
- 1 cup uncooked orzo pasta
- ⅓ cup finely chopped carrot

## Instructions

1. Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and onion powder in a bowl; shape into 3/4-inch balls.
