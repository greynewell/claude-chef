## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 6  chicken breast tenders
- 1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 cup instant rice
- 1 cup water
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (.18 ounce) packet sazon seasoning
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 8  extra-large flour tortillas
- 1 (16 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 1 tablespoon softened butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and 1 teaspoon garlic salt, shredding chicken as it cooks until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes.
2. Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes.
3. Stir black beans, 1 packet sazon seasoning, and teaspoon garlic salt together in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook in microwave until heated through, about 2 minutes. Add black bean mixture to rice.
4. Place each tortilla on a work surface; layer half of each tortilla with bean-rice mixture, Mexican cheese, shredded chicken, and more Mexican cheese. Fold each tortilla in half. Spread a thin layer of softened butter atop each quesadilla.
5. Heat a large skillet over medium heat; cook each quesadilla, butter-side down, until cheese is melted and outside is crisp and brown, about 5 minutes per side. Cut into wedges.
