## Ingredients

- 8 medium heirloom tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons oil, or as needed
- 1 medium white onion, chopped, divided
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, divided
- ¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning, or to taste
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- salt to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) package fresh spinach
- 1 (8 ounce) ball mozzarella cheese, cut into bite-sized cubes

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Cut tomatoes in half and put on a baking sheet.
2. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.
3. Put enough oil in a large pot to cover the bottom. Add 2/3 of the onion, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning; sizzle over low heat for 10 minutes.
4. Place roasted tomatoes and chicken stock in a large pot. Mix well and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, cover, and reduce heat to low; cook for 2 to 3 hours.
5. Ten minutes before the soup is ready, heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium heat; stir in remaining onion. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add remaining garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minutes. Add spinach and salt; cook until wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
7. Pour soup into individual ceramic bowls. Place spinach mixture and mozzarella cubes on top of each soup.
8. Place soups in the preheated oven and broil until cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
