## Ingredients

- 1 cup mashed ripe bananas
- ¼ cup honey
- ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
- ¼ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ cup plain Greek yogurt
- 3 tablespoons skim milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon molasses
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 ½ cups white whole wheat flour
- 2 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup frozen blueberries
- 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease the bottom of 12 muffin cups or use paper liners.
2. Beat bananas, honey, applesauce, brown sugar, yogurt, milk, oil, molasses, and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Gently stir whole wheat flour, baking powder, and salt into the batter.
