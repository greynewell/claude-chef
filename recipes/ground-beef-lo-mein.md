## Ingredients

- 6 ounces spaghetti
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 tablespoon dry sherry
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  red bell pepper, cored and sliced vertically
- 1  sweet onion, peeled and sliced vertically
- 1 cup snow peas

- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, but still a little chunky, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside.
3. Whisk hoisin sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, water, sherry, sesame oil, cornstarch, and brown sugar together in a small bowl.
4. Heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add red bell pepper, onion, snow peas, celery, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Return ground beef to the skillet and mix well.
5. Drain spaghetti and to the skillet with the sauce. Cook and stir until mixture is well combined and sauce has slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately and garnish with sliced green onions.
