## Ingredients

- ¾ cup chicken broth
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 6 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut in half
- 2 medium green onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, vinegar, honey, sugar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in a large skillet over medium heat. When mixture starts to sizzle, add chicken and bring to a boil.
2. Turn down the heat and let simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a serving platter, leaving remaining sauce in the skillet.
3. Turn heat to high and cook until sauce becomes a thick glaze. Remove from heat and pour over chicken. Sprinkle with green onions and sesame seeds.
