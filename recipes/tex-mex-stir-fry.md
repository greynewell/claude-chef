## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, chopped
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite size pieces
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup prepared salsa
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is very hot, and cook and stir the green and red bell pepper until they are starting to become tender, about 5 minutes. Set the peppers aside.
2. Mix flour and taco seasoning in a bowl, and stir in chicken pieces, a few at a time, to thoroughly coat with the flour mixture. Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook and stir the chicken until no longer pink and the coating is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the bell peppers, black beans, and salsa, and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes to blend the flavors.
3. To serve, sprinkle each portion with Cheddar cheese.
