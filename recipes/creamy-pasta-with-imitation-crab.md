## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound imitation crabmeat, diced
- 1 (16 ounce) package rotini pasta
- 1 cup half-and-half
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
2. At the same time, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil; cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in imitation crab and heat for 2 minutes.
