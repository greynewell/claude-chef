## Ingredients

- 1 pound dry pinto beans, rinsed
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
- 1 medium tomato, diced
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Place beans in a large saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. When beans come to a boil, drain and return them to the same pot.
2. Cover beans with water by 2 inches; stir in 1 tablespoon garlic, tomato, cumin, and chili powder. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until beans are very soft, about 3 hours and 45 minutes, adding water as needed.
3. Once beans have cooked, mash them with remaining garlic, oil, and salt; add water as needed to achieve desired consistency. Place over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
