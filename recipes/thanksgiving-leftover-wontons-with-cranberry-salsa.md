## Ingredients

- ¾ cup lemon juice
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- 1 ½ cups shredded cooked turkey
- 1 cup prepared stuffing
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ¼ cup thick turkey gravy
- 1 (14 ounce) package wonton wrappers
- salt to taste
- 3 cups canola oil for frying
- 2 tablespoons minced onion
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 teaspoon seeded and minced jalapeno pepper - or to taste
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon water

## Instructions

1. Pour the lemon juice over the dried cranberries in a bowl; set aside. Mix the turkey, stuffing, cream cheese, and turkey gravy in a separate bowl until thoroughly combined.
2. Place a wonton wrapper on a work surface; spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Moisten two opposite edges of the wrapper with a finger dipped in water, fold the wrapper in half the long way, and press the edges together with a fork. Sprinkle the wrapper with salt. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.
3. Heat the canola oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat; pan-fry the filled wontons in batches until crisp and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Drain the fried wontons on paper towels; allow to cool for about 5 minutes to set the filling.
4. Drain the lemon juice from the dried cranberries. Place cranberries into a food processor; pulse several times until the cranberries are finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the onion, lime juice, jalapeno pepper, garlic, and water. Serve with the hot fried wontons.
