## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 cup chopped onions
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon red curry paste, or more to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 pounds butternut squash cubes
- 1 small tart apple - peeled, cored and chopped
- 2 cups water, or as needed to cover
- 1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
- ½ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Heat coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat; stir in onions. Cook and stir until onions are soft and starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onions are very tender and caramelized, at least 30 minutes more.
2. Add tomato paste and 1 teaspoon curry paste; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add butternut squash and apple; cook, stirring constantly, until evenly coated with spices, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. Pour just enough water into the pot to almost cover squash and apple. Stir, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until squash is very tender, 30 to 45 minutes.
4. Reduce heat to low and stir in coconut milk and ginger. Puree soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Add sugar and salt, and more curry paste if needed. If soup isn't smooth enough, cook an additional 20 to 30 minutes and puree again.
5. Stir in heavy cream. Add more water if soup is too thick. Taste and adjust seasonings. Serve hot.
