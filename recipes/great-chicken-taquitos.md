## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 3 ½ cups vegetable oil (such as Crisco®), divided
- 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes
- ½ cup minced green onions
- 6 tablespoons chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- 12  wooden picks
- 1 cup shredded lettuce, or to taste
- ¼ cup guacamole, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring water to a simmer in a skillet over medium heat; add chicken. Cover the skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from water and cool; shred with a fork. Discard water and dry the skillet with a paper towel.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shredded chicken, tomatoes, green onions, chicken broth, flour, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, and salt until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.
3. Heat remaining vegetable oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat; carefully dip tortillas in hot oil to soften, about 1 minute. Remove tortillas with tongs and drain on paper towels, reserving oil in the skillet.
4. Heat reserved oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
5. Spoon about 2 tablespoons chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Tightly roll each tortilla around the filling and secure with a wooden toothpick.
6. Working in batches, fry rolled tortillas in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove taquitos with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve taquitos on a bed of shredded lettuce with guacamole on the side.
