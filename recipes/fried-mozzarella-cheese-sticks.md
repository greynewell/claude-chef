## Ingredients

- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¼ cup water
- 1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- ⅔ cup all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup cornstarch
- 1 quart oil for deep frying
- 1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks

## Instructions

1. Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.
2. Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.
3. Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
4. Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.
