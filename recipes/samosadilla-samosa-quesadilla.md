## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled
- kosher salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons garam masala
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1  serrano pepper, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 ½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger
- 1 cup green peas
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
- 1  lemon, juiced
- 2 small bunches fresh cilantro with stems
- ⅓ cup fresh mint leaves
- ¼ cup sliced green onions
- 1  serrano pepper, sliced
- 1  limes, juiced, or more to taste
- ½ cup plain yogurt
- salt to taste
- 6  flour tortillas, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch cubes. Transfer into a pot of cold water. Stir in salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer over medium heat until cubes are tender but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion. Cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine 1 teaspoon kosher salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl for the spice mix.
3. Add serrano pepper, garlic, ginger, and the spice mix to the onions. Cook and stir until mixture is well combined, about 2 minutes. Add peas; cook until heated through and slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
4. Transfer mixture into a bowl with the potatoes. Add cilantro and lemon juice. Mix with a spatula until filling is well combined, with some potatoes partially mashed. Add more salt if needed.
5. Combine cilantro, mint, green onions, serrano pepper, lime juice, and yogurt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Season with salt.
6. Spread a few spoonfuls of the filling over one half of 1 tortilla. Fold in half. Repeat with remaining filling and tortillas.
7. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook each quesadilla until browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer quesadilla onto your work surface and cut in thirds. Plate and serve at any temperature, alongside the chutney sauce.
