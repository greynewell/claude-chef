## Ingredients

- ½ cup fresh lemon juice
- ½ cup fat-free chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- cooking spray
- 1 pound small new potatoes, halved

## Instructions

1. Combine lemon juice, chicken broth, olive oil, garlic, and oregano in a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, seal bag, and shake so chicken is well coated with marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x11-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
3. Pour chicken and marinade into the prepared baking pan. Arrange potatoes around the chicken.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
