## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1  onion, chopped
- ½ pint sour cream
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
