## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup cold butter, cut into small cubes
- ½ cup cold nonfat Greek yogurt
- ¼ cup cold seltzer, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a knife until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Place the bowl in the freezer for 5 minutes.
4. Stir in Greek yogurt until dough is combined. Add 1/4 cup seltzer; mix until dough is smooth. Add more seltzer if dough appears dry.
5. Place dough on a floured piece of parchment paper and pat into a flat rectangle. Fold the rectangle in thirds. Rotate dough 90 degrees, gather any crumbs, and flatten into a rectangle again. Repeat folding, turning, and flattening twice more.
6. Flatten dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut into twelve 2 1/2-inch rounds. Transfer rounds to a baking sheet.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
