## Ingredients

- 2 cups penne pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- ½ cup half-and-half
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cream, half-and-half, and garlic salt. Add Gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Oaxaca cheese. Stir into cream until melted. Drain pasta and add to the sauce; stir to coat.
