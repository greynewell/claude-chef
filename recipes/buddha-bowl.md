## Ingredients

- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1 ½ cups quinoa
- 1 large sweet potato, diced
- 1 large red onion, diced
- ¼ cup olive oil, divided
- kosher salt to taste
- freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced, divided
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup lime juice
- 2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cups baby spinach
- 1  avocado - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Spread sweet potato and red onion onto a baking sheet. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over mixture and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
5. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir 2 cloves garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into 1-inch pieces.
6. Whisk 1 garlic clove, lime juice, peanut butter, soy sauce, and honey together in a bowl. Whisk 1 tablespoon olive oil and sesame oil into mixture until dressing is smooth.
7. Divide quinoa among bowls; top with chicken, sweet potato mixture, spinach, and avocado. Sprinkle cilantro and sesame seeds over the top and drizzle dressing over each bowl.
