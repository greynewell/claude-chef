## Ingredients

- ½ tablespoon sesame oil, or to taste
- 4 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 4 cups shredded cabbage
- 1 (14 ounce) can bean sprouts, drained and rinsed
- 4 tablespoons oyster sauce
- ½ pound tiny cooked shrimp
- 3 dashes soy sauce, or to taste
- oil for frying
- 12  egg roll wrappers
- 1 cup duck sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Heat sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ginger and garlic; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cabbage, bean sprouts, and oyster sauce; saute until veggies start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp and soy sauce, stir, and remove from heat. Set aside until filling is cool enough to handle.
2. Heat 2 inches oil in a deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. While oil is heating, place an egg roll wrapper on a dry work surface. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling onto the center of the wrapper. Pull the bottom left corner over the filling and fold the two sides in, moistening edges with water as you go; roll tightly to seal. Repeat to make a few more egg rolls, wiping the work surface between each roll.
4. Place several egg rolls in the hot oil and fry until wrappers are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain while you make and cook remaining egg rolls.
5. Combine duck sauce, oyster sauce, and soy sauce; stir until well combined. Serve sauce with egg rolls.
