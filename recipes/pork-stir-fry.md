## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
- 1 (1 pound) pork tenderloin, cut into strips
- 1  fresh red chile pepper, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 head bok choy, leaves and stalks separated, chopped
- 2 crowns broccoli, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, and cornstarch together in a small bowl; set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir tenderloin strips in hot oil until just browned, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer pork to a plate and return the wok to heat.
3. Add remaining sesame oil to the wok; cook and stir red chile pepper and garlic in hot oil until sizzling, 15 to 30 seconds. Add onion and bell pepper; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir chopped bok choy stalks into onion mixture; cook and stir until stems begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
4. Add broccoli to the wok; cook and stir until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add pork, chopped bok choy leaves, and soy sauce mixture; cook and stir until well-combined. Season pork mixture with ginger; cook and stir until bok choy leaves start to wilt and broccoli is tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
