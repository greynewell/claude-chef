## Ingredients

- 1 (1 pound) skin-on salmon fillet
- ½ cup light soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon sesame seeds  (Optional)
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a heat-resistant baking dish (such as Pyrex®) with aluminum foil and place salmon, skin-side down, in the dish.
2. Mix soy sauce, ginger, honey, sesame seeds, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl until honey is dissolved. Pour over salmon fillet, making sure top of salmon is completely covered.
3. Cook under the preheated broiler until top of salmon has begun to turn golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and baste the top of the fillet with the pan drippings. Turn the broiler off and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
4. Return to the preheated oven and bake until fish has a rich, dark brown glaze and flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove skin and serve.
