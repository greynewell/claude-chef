## Ingredients

- 8 ounces pancetta bacon, thickly sliced
- 1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed
- 12 ounces pizza dough, or more to taste, cut into quarters
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 cup olive oil, or as needed
- ½ cup ricotta cheese
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 20 slices fresh peach
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste
- 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
2. Line baking sheets with aluminum foil.
3. Sprinkle pancetta into a cold skillet and drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over pancetta.
4. Cook and stir pancetta over medium heat until browned and caramelized, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Remove pan from heat and cool pancetta in the oil in the skillet.
6. Place 1 dough quarter on a work surface and lightly dust with flour; roll into a 1/8-inch-thick irregularly shaped crust.
7. Stretch dough with your hands to an even thickness; let rest on the work surface for 5 minutes.
8. Repeat with remaining dough.
9. Heat about 1 cup olive oil, reaching about 1/2-inch depth, in a heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
10. Fry each piece of dough until browned and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.
11. The first side will be lighter than the second side.
12. Drain the crusts on paper towels.
13. Transfer pizza crusts, lighter-side up, to prepared baking sheets.
14. Spread about 2 tablespoons ricotta cheese onto each crust using the back of a spoon.
15. Sprinkle about 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme over ricotta layer.
16. Sprinkle pancetta over the ricotta-thyme layer; season with black pepper.
17. Nestle about 5 peach slices onto each pizza, working around the pancetta pieces.
18. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan-Reggiano cheese over each pizza.
19. Drizzle about 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil over Parmesan-Reggiano layer.
20. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and peaches are lightly browned and tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
21. Cool pizzas for 5 to 10 minutes on the baking sheet.
