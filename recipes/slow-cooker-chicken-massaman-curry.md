## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
- 6  red potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 2 cups carrots, cut into bite-size chunks
- 1 cup mixed red, yellow, and orange bell peppers, cut into bite-sized chunks  (Optional)
- 2  onions, cut into chunks
- 4 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (such as Maesri Masaman Curry®)
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger paste (such as Gourmet Garden™)
- 2 teaspoons lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet Garden™)
- 2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk, divided
- 2 cups chicken stock, such as (Kitchen Basics®)
- ¼ cup peanut butter
- 4 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste
- 1 cup dry roasted peanuts, chopped, divided
- 6 cups cooked jasmine rice

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Add chicken pieces in batches, cooking until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place browned chicken in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers on top of the meat in the slow cooker.
2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet and add onion. Cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add to slow cooker. Add red curry paste, ginger paste, and lemongrass paste to the skillet and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1 can coconut milk; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.
3. Whisk in remaining 1 can coconut milk, chicken broth, and peanut butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over ingredients in the slow cooker; stir gently to combine.
4. Set slow cooker to Low and cook until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 4 to 6 hours.
5. 20 minutes before serving season with lemon juice, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts. Serve with hot cooked rice and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of peanuts.
