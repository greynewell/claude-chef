## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup chopped crystallized ginger
- 1 ½ tablespoons grated orange zest
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup unsweetened applesauce
- ½ cup brewed black tea
- 2  eggs
- ½ cup white sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- ¼ cup sunflower seed oil
- ½ tablespoon ground turmeric, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper.
2. Mix flour, ginger, baking powder, orange zest, baking powder, five-spice, and salt together.
3. Mix applesauce and tea together in a separate bowl.
4. Beat eggs with 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until very fluffy and light. Pour in oil gradually and beat on medium speed until combined. Alternate adding the flour and applesauce mixtures, mixing just until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven and let cool for 30 minutes. Place a wire rack over the cake pan and flip to release cake onto the rack. Let cool completely, at least 45 minutes.
7. Cut parchment paper into any shapes you like to act as stencils. Brush lightly with water and stick them over the surface of the cake. Gently sprinkle turmeric around the shapes. Carefully lift up stencils.
