## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups lightly packed fresh parsley
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup rice vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper  (Optional)
- 1 head romaine lettuce, shredded
- ¾ cup coarsely shredded carrot
- ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- ½ cup fresh mint leaves
- 2  green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 ounce rice vermicelli noodles
- 10  rice paper sheets
- 10 sprigs fresh Italian parsley
- 10  cooked peeled and deveined shrimp, halved lengthwise
- 1 tablespoon reduced-sodium soy sauce, or to taste  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Pulse parsley, oil, rice vinegar, garlic, salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper in a food processor or blender until chopped but not pureed. Transfer to a large bowl.
2. Stir lettuce, carrot, cilantro, mint, and green onions into chimichurri sauce. Let stand, stirring occasionally, 15 to 30 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rice noodles. Cook until just tender, about 3 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water; drain again. Snip noodles into small pieces.
4. Pour some warm water into a pie plate. For each spring roll, carefully dip 1 rice paper into the water and transfer to a dinner plate. Let stand several seconds to soften. Put 1 parsley sprig and 2 shrimp halves just below the center of the paper; top with about 1/3 cup vegetable mixture and some of the rice noodles. Tightly roll up rice paper from the bottom, tucking in the sides as you roll.
5. Serve spring rolls with soy sauce and sprinkle with remaining crushed red pepper.
