6. With an immersion blender, blend the mixture until smooth.
7. Transfer the shredded turkey, onions, garlic, 3 more cans of cannellini beans, the cilantro, cumin, and Cajun seasoning into the slow cooker, and stir to combine.
8. Wearing gloves, cut off the serrano chile stems, split the chiles, and scrape the seeds and membranes from 2 of the chiles with a spoon.
9. Mince all 3 chiles.
10. For milder flavor, seed and remove membranes from all the chiles.
11. Mix the serrano chiles into the soup.
