## Ingredients

- 1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- ½ cup uncooked fusilli pasta
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon dried Italian herb mix, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
- ¼ cup white wine
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2  green onions, sliced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a saucepan with enough water to cover broccoli rabe, sprinkle in some salt, and bring to a boil. Stir in broccoli rabe and cook until bright green and just starting to become tender, about 2 minutes; drain and cool in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain well, and pat dry with paper towels.
2. Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once water is boiling, stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well.
3. While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in 2 roughly-chopped garlic cloves until they start to turn translucent, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper; stir in rosemary sprig, dried Italian herb mix, and crushed red pepper flakes.
4. Stir in blanched rabe, white wine, and tomatoes; remove rosemary sprig and bring to a boil. Mix in pasta, green onions, and 1 minced clove of garlic; simmer for 1 more minute, and serve topped with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.
