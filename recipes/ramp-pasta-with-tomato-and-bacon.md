## Ingredients

- 3 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1 cup ramp, wild leek
- 1 teaspoon capers
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound penne pasta
- 4 slices bacon, finely chopped
- 1 pinch white sugar, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Cut a small "x" into the bottom of each tomato.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tomatoes to the boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds until skin starts to peel off. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain in a colander. Immediately immerse in the ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain, peel, and chop.
3. Combine tomatoes, ramps, capers, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a blender; blend until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet. Add bacon and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato-ramp mixture and cook until hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of pasta water and mix to combine. Season with salt, pepper, and sugar.
6. Drain penne and mix with sauce.
