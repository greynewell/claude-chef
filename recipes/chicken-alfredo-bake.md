## Ingredients

- 2 cups penne pasta
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ½ cup 1% milk
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
