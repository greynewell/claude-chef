## Ingredients

- 1 ½ (16 ounce) packages linguine pasta
- 1 cup olive oil, or as needed
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 (2 ounce) can anchovy fillets packed in olive oil, drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 ½ pounds clams in shell, scrubbed
- ⅓ pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on
- ⅓ pound bay scallops
- ½ pound squid - tentacles and tubes, cleaned and cut into rings
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1  lemon, cut into wedges
- 1 tablespoon grated Manchego cheese
- 1 tablespoon julienned fresh basil leaves

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Heat a large skillet covered with about 1/4-inch of olive oil over low heat. Add garlic, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and anchovies; cook and stir until the anchovies melt into the oil, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes; increase the heat to medium, and bring to a simmer. Stir in the clams. Once they begin to open, arrange the shrimp in a single layer and allow to simmer. Flip the shrimp when they become pink on one side, about 2 minutes, then drop in the scallops and squid. Continue cooking until the shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 more minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and remaining 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning.
3. Toss the cooked pasta into the sauce. Garnish with a lemon wedge, Manchego cheese, and basil before serving.
