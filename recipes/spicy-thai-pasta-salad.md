## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1 ½ teaspoons seasoned rice vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
- ½ cup frozen peas, thawed
- ¼ cup shredded carrots
- ¼ cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
- 3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons dry-roasted peanuts
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk sesame oil, vegetable oil, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, fish sauce, chili-garlic sauce, lime juice, rice vinegar, and sugar for dressing together in a small bowl until well combined. Set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
