## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 10 ounces salmon fillet, cut into cubes
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound tomatoes, chopped
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
- 1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- ¾ cup heavy whipping cream

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat while spaghetti is cooking and cook salmon and garlic until salmon is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
