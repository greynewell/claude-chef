## Ingredients

- 10 ounces fettuccini pasta
- ½ cup butter
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1  egg yolk
- 2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet melt butter and add chopped garlic. Cook on low for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent garlic from burning.
3. Pour about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream into a small bowl. Add egg yolk and beat together; set aside.
4. Pour remaining cream into the skillet. Increase heat to medium-high. As cream starts to boil, mix rapidly using a whisk. Add egg mixture slowly to prevent curdling, whisking until well blended. Stir in 1 cup Parmesan cheese until combined.
5. Add remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley; mix until smooth. Remove from heat and serve over cooked pasta.
