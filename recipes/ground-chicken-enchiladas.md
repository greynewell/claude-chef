## Ingredients

- olive oil cooking spray
- 1 pound ground chicken
- 1 medium onion, minced
- 1 (1 ounce) envelope taco seasoning mix
- ½ cup water
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup
- ⅓ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cut into chunks
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce
- 8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 cup shredded Mexican-blend cheese
- 1 bunch green onions, sliced
- 1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground chicken and onion in the hot skillet until chicken is no longer pink, crumbly, and onion is soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle taco seasoning over top and add 1/2 cup water. Stir and cook until water is evaporated, 5 to 8 minutes. Add cream of chicken soup, cream cheese chunks, and sour cream. Stir until melted and fully incorporated. Stir in black pepper.
3. Pour one can of enchilada sauce into the prepared baking dish and spread to cover the bottom. Divide chicken mixture between the 8 tortillas and roll up tightly. Place filled tortillas in the prepared baking dish, seam-side down. Five should fit lengthwise and the remaining three should fit widthwise to fill the dish. Pour second can of enchilada sauce on top of rolled tortillas. Cover the dish tightly with foil.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and remove foil. Sprinkle with both shredded cheeses, then green onions and black olives. Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and allow to sit, 8 to 10 minutes before serving.
