## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 4 cups leftover cooked rice
- 1 cup frozen peas and carrots
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- ½ tablespoon Sriracha  (Optional)
- 4 large eggs
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon shredded nori, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon sliced scallions, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon black sesame seeds, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add Spam® and fry until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
2. Heat sesame oil in the same pan until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add onion and saute until it softens slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and add rice and frozen vegetables; mix and fry until heated through, about 5 minutes. Push the rice mixture to the sides or edges of the pan, add beaten eggs to the center, and scramble until curds form, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Stir half of the Spam® back into the pan and mix the eggs in with the rest of the rice mixture. Add soy sauce and Sriracha. Mix and remove from the heat.
4. Crack remaining eggs into a skillet over medium heat. Cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until whites are completely set, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Place fried eggs on top of the fried rice, add reserved Spam®, and garnish with nori, scallions, and sesame seeds.
