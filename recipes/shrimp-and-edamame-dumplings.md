## Ingredients

- 1 cup frozen shelled edamame (green soybeans)
- ⅓ pound large shrimp - peeled, deveined, and cut into 1/3-inch pieces
- ½ cup finely chopped bok choy
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons water
- 36  dumpling wrappers
- ¼ cup peanut oil, divided
- 1 cup water, divided
- ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1  green onion, sliced
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the insert. Bring the water to a boil. Add the edamame, place a cover on the saucepan, and steam until just tender, 2 to 6.
2. Place steamed edamame in a food processor; blend until smooth. Transfer edamame puree to a large bowl.
3. Stir the shrimp, bok choy, egg white, ginger, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, garlic, and salt into the edamame puree.
4. Pour about 2 tablespoons water in a dish.
5. Scoop about 1 teaspoon of the shrimp mixture onto the center of a dumpling wrapper.
6. Wet the edge of the wrapper with water, then fold over to create a half-moon shape; pinch edge to seal.
7. Place the finished dumpling on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a damp towel; repeat with remaining wrappers.
8. Working in batches of 6 to 8 dumplings, heat about 1 tablespoon peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry dumplings until crispy on one side, about 2 minutes.
9. Flip dumplings and cook for 1 more minute. Add 1/4 cup water to the skillet and cover.
10. Steam dumplings until shrimp are bright pink and no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dumplings.
11. For the dipping sauce: Whisk low-sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, green onion, sugar, rice vinegar, and red pepper flakes together in a shallow bowl until sugar has dissolved.
