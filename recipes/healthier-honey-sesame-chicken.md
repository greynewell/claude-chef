## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup honey
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 pound chicken breast, cut into 1-inch cubes

## Instructions

1. Mix honey, ketchup, oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce, lemon juice, Sriracha sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and ginger in a medium bowl until well combined. Add chicken pieces and stir to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
3. Transfer chicken and sauce into an oven-proof dish.
