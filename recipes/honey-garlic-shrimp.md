## Ingredients

- 1 pound large raw shrimp (16-20 count), peeled and deveined
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon freshly grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup thinly sliced green onion, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Make sure shrimp are fully thawed and well drained. Keep in the refrigerator while you make the marinade.
2. Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl.
3. Add shrimp and toss thoroughly with a spatula for 2 minutes until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally while marinating.
4. Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and heat over high heat until you begin to see small wisps of smoke. Use tongs to immediately transfer shrimp into the hot skillet in a single layer. Set excess marinade aside.
5. Sear shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip over. Dump in marinade and cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat and flip shrimp once more; let sit for about 1 minute. The marinade in the pan will reduce down to a beautiful glaze just from the residual heat in the pan. Garnish with green onion.
