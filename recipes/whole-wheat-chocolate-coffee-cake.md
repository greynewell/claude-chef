## Ingredients

- 1 ¾ cups whole wheat flour
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup brewed black coffee, at room temperature
- 3 tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- ¾ cup unsweetened applesauce
- ¾ cup pure maple syrup
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips
- ¾ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon powdered sugar, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan.
2. Whisk whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt together in a medium bowl.
3. Whisk brewed coffee and espresso powder together in a large bowl. Add Greek yogurt, applesauce, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract; whish until thoroughly combined and no lumps remain. Stir in 1/2 of the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients. Fold in chocolate chips and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan and place the pan onto a baking sheet.
4. Place both pans in the preheated oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Gently run a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen. Remove the sides of the pan and allow cake to cool completely, 15 to 30 minutes more.
5. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
