## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package thin spaghetti, broken in half
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ pounds chicken tenders, cut into bite-size pieces
- 4 stalks celery, sliced
- 2  red bell peppers, sliced
- 1  red onion, sliced
- ⅔ cup shredded carrots
- 1 cup chicken broth
- ½ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ¾ cup unsalted peanuts
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.
2. Heat oil in a large non-stick pan or wok over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Add celery, red bell peppers, red onion, and carrots; cook and stir until vegetables are slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
3. Mix chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, garlic powder, and sesame oil in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until desired thickness of sauce is reached, 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir peanuts, garlic, and red pepper flakes into chicken-vegetables mixture; cook for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over chicken-vegetable mixture; add spaghetti and toss to coat.
