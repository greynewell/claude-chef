## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)  (Optional)
- 1 pound beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
- 1  carrot, julienned
- 1  green onion, chopped
- ½  yellow onion, chopped

## Instructions

1. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, garlic, sugar, salt, black pepper, and MSG. Place beef, carrots, and onions in the bag; seal, and shake to coat the vegetables and beef with the sauce. Refrigerate for at least 2 1/2 hours. I prefer to marinate mine overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Remove meat and vegetables from marinade, and place on a large sheet of aluminum foil; seal. Discard marinade.
3. Place on grill, and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or to desired doneness.
