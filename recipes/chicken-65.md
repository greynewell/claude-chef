## Ingredients

- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic, divided
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger, divided
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- vegetable oil for frying
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 2  serrano peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons cumin powder
- 1 tablespoon chile powder, or less to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- salt to taste
- 6  fresh curry leaves, or more to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons red chile-garlic paste
- 1 tablespoon ginger paste
- 5 drops red food coloring, or more as needed
- ½ cup water
- ¾ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Place chicken in a medium bowl. Add egg, cornstarch, 1/2 of the minced garlic, 1/2 of the minced ginger, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Mix until chicken is completely coated.
2. Heat oil in a deep skillet and fry chicken pieces until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Set fried chicken aside.
3. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a second skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook until crackling, about 1 minute. Add remaining garlic, remaining ginger, serrano peppers, cumin, chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and salt. Add curry leaves and stir to combine. Add chile-garlic paste, ginger paste, and red food coloring. Stir to create a paste. Add water to thin paste slightly.
4. Add fried chicken to the the skillet and toss to coat thoroughly. Stir in cilantro.
