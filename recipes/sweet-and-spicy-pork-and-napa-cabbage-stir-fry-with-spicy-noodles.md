## Ingredients

- 12 ounces dry Chinese noodles
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- ¾ cup sweet chili sauce
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (1 pound) pork loin, cut into 2-inch strips
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- 2  onions, cut into bite-size pieces
- ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
- 3 cups chopped napa cabbage
- ¾ cup sliced celery
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 3  red bell peppers, chopped
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- ¼ cup cold water

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Whisk together 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 3/4 cup sweet chili sauce, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, ground ginger, and sesame oil in a large bowl; add drained noodles and toss to coat; set aside.
3. Whisk together 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in a large bowl; add pork and stir to coat. Allow to marinate 5 minutes.
4. Heat cooking oil in a wok or a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork, onions, and red pepper flakes; cook until pork is browned completely. Stir in 3 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, napa cabbage, celery, carrots, and bell peppers; cook and stir until vegetables are heated through, about 5 minutes.
5. Whisk together cornstarch and water in a bowl; add to stir-fry, stirring until mixture thickens. Serve stir-fry over noodles.
