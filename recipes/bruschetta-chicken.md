## Ingredients

- 4 (5 ounce) boneless skinless chicken breasts
- ¼ cup Mazola® Corn Oil
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 2  garlic cloves, finely minced
- 1 tablespoon Spice Islands® Italian Herb Seasoning
- ½ teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Sea Salt
- ¼ teaspoon Spice Islands® Fine Grind Black Pepper
- 2 cups diced plum tomatoes
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- ½ cup shredded Italian blend cheese

## Instructions

1. Place chicken breasts in a large resealable plastic freezer bag, one at a time. Lightly pound chicken breasts to an even thickness of about 3/4-inch. Combine oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, Italian herb seasoning, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and whisk until combined. Pour half of the marinade over the chicken, reseal bag, and set aside to marinate for at least 15 minutes. (Chicken and marinade can be prepared ahead; covered and refrigerated overnight.)

Transfer chicken from marinade onto grill surface and discard marinade. Grill chicken for 4 to 6 minutes per side or until cooked through. Transfer the chicken to a serving plate and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Spoon bruschetta mixture over chicken and top with basil; serve immediately.
