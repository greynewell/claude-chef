## Ingredients

- 6  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, or more to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) container whipped cream cheese
- ¾ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1  tomato, diced
- 1 (6 ounce) can chopped black olives
- ¼  onion, chopped
- ¼ cup chopped fresh spinach

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Cut each chicken breast from one side through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book.
3. Mix cream cheese, feta cheese, tomato, olives, onion, and spinach together in a large bowl. Spoon cheese mixture onto 1 side of each opened chicken breast. Fold each chicken breast closed and place on a piece of aluminum foil.
4. Cook the chicken breasts on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
