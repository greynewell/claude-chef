## Ingredients

- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup butter, melted
- 2 cups white sugar
- 4  eggs
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 large very ripe bananas, mashed
- 2  apples, cubed
- ¾ cup chopped walnuts  (Optional)
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons butter, softened
- banana slices for garnish
- apple slices for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 7x3-inch loaf pans.
2. Make the bread: Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Beat sugar and melted butter in a large mixing bowl until smooth. Mix in eggs, one at a time, followed by yogurt and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture just until incorporated.
4. Fold in bananas, apples, and walnuts until combined with small chunks of banana still visible in the batter; do not overmix. Pour 1/2 of the batter into each prepared pan.
5. Make the topping: Mix brown sugar, white sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
6. Sprinkle 1/2 of the topping over each loaf. Garnish each loaf with banana and apple slices.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove and cover each pan with aluminum foil.
8. Return to the oven, and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.
9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.
