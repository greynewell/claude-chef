## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon chili powder  (Optional)
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- water as needed
- 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), rinsed and drained
- 1 cup water, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 2  tomatoes, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Melt ghee with oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute ginger and garlic in the ghee mixture until aromatic and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion; continue to saute until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes more.
2. Mix curry powder, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garam masala, and turmeric together in a bowl; add to the skillet and stir. Stir enough water into the skillet to get the mixture to be paste-like; cook to let the flavors intensify for about 30 seconds.
3. Stir sweet potato, chickpeas, 1 cup water, and salt into the mixture in the skillet; cook at a simmer until the sweet potato is just tender, about 10 minutes. Thin the mixture with more water if too thick.
4. Stir tomatoes into the sweet potato mixture, bring to a boil, and cook until the liquid reduces to a thick gravy, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.
