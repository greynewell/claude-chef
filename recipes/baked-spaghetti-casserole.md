## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 12 ounces spaghetti
- 4  eggs, beaten
- ⅔ cup Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup cottage cheese, or more to taste
- 1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
