## Ingredients

- 1 (4 ounce) package kasseri cheese
- 1 tablespoon water, or as needed
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons brandy, at room temperature
- ½  lemon, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon freshly chopped Italian parsley

## Instructions

1. Brush each side of kasseri cheese with water; dredge both sides in flour, making sure the surface is completely covered.
2. Preheat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet on medium-high heat until smoking; pour in olive oil. Carefully place floured cheese in hot oil and cook until cheese begins to ooze and a golden-brown crust forms, about 2 minutes. Quickly flip cheese over with a spatula. Fry until the bottom is golden brown, about 30 seconds more.
3. Remove from the heat and place skillet onto a napkin-lined plate. Pour brandy into the skillet over the cheese. Light the brandy using a fireplace lighter. Squeeze some lemon juice on top to extinguish the last few flames and garnish with parsley.
