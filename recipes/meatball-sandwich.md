## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ¾ cup bread crumbs
- 2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1  French baguette
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 pinch salt, or to taste
- 1 (14 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 4 slices provolone cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and Italian seasoning in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well combined. Shape mixture into 12 meatballs, and place in a baking dish.
3. Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
4. While the meatballs are cooking, cut baguette in half lengthwise and open like a book. Remove and discard remove some of the bread from the inside to make a well for the meatballs. Brush with olive oil and season with garlic powder and salt. Place baguette on a baking tray, open and with the oiled sides facing up.
5. When the meatballs have 5 minutes left, slip the baguette into the oven and cook until lightly toasted.
6. Meanwhile, warm spaghetti sauce in a saucepan over medium heat.
7. Remove meatballs from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to the hot sauce; mix gently to coat with sauce.
8. Spoon meatballs and sauce into one side of the baguette, nestling meatballs in the well. Top with slices of provolone cheese.
9. Return to the oven until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
10. Cool slightly, then cut into 4 sandwiches.
