## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- 6 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- 1 (8 ounce) pre-cooked ham steak, diced
- ½ cup diced yellow onion
- ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers
- cooking spray
- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 1 ¾ cups pico de gallo
- 6 large eggs
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 medium avocado, diced
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tortillas, one at a time, until golden and lightly crisp, about 30 seconds per side. Drain on paper towels and set aside.
3. Add ham to the skillet and cook until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Transfer ham with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
4. Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in the skillet. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent. Add beans and green chiles; cook, stirring and partially mashing, for 1 minute. Remove from heat.
5. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish liberally with cooking spray. Place tortillas in a single layer on the bottom. Sprinkle ham and cheese over the tortillas. Top evenly with the black bean mixture and pico de gallo. Form 6 shallow wells in the pico layer; crack an egg into each well.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until egg whites are just set and yolks are runny, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle with pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Top with avocado and cilantro.
