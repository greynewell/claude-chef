## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup coconut oil, at room temperature
- ½ cup butter, at room temperature
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup turbinado (raw) sugar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 1 ½ cups dried cherries, roughly chopped
- ¾ cup sweetened shredded coconut
- ½ cup milk chocolate chips, roughly chopped
- ¾ cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons cherry jam
- 1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 24-cup mini muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.
2. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Combine coconut oil, butter, white sugar, turbinado sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer on high speed until well combined, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add yogurt and almond extract and beat on medium-low to incorporate. Mix in flour mixture on the lowest speed until batter is just combined.
4. Fold cherries, coconut, and milk chocolate chips into the batter. Fill muffin tins 3/4-full of batter using a small scoop.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
6. Combine confectioners' sugar, cherry jam, and heavy cream in a small bowl; mix with a spoon until no lumps of confectioners' sugar are visible and glaze is smooth. Thin with more cream if needed. Drizzle over scuffins.
