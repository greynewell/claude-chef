## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- ¾ cup low-sodium soy sauce
- ¼ cup teriyaki marinade
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon smoked salt
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper  (Optional)
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Cut chicken with the grain into very thin strips, about 1/4-inch thick, while still mostly frozen.
2. Mix soy sauce, teriyaki marinade, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, lemon juice, smoked salt, ginger, garlic powder, black pepper, and red pepper together in a small bowl. Place chicken strips in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over the meat and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour and up to overnight.
3. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Prepare a jelly roll pan by placing a wire rack on top and coating it with cooking spray.
4. Place chicken strips on the rack as close together as possible without having them touch.
5. Bake in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until each piece is a uniform dark orange color and dry inside when cut in half, 4 to 5 hours total.
