## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1  sweet onion (such as Vidalia®), thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (10 ounce) package flour tortillas
- cooking spray
- 6 ounces Brie cheese, cut into 1/4-inch slices
- 2  ripe d'Anjou pears, sliced 1/4-inch thick

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until soft and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in honey, thyme, salt, and pepper; continue to cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Add pears and cook until just softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
2. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and grease with nonstick cooking spray. Place 1 tortilla in the skillet and top with 1/4 of the Brie. Add 1/4 of the onion-pear mixture and cover with a second tortilla. Weigh down quesadilla with a smaller skillet or plate and cook until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.
3. Repeat with remaining tortillas, Brie cheese, and onion-pear mixture. Slice quesadillas into wedges, or wrap in foil to take along for a picnic.
