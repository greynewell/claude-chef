## Ingredients

- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- 1 (16 ounce) package small whole-wheat pasta shells
- 1 cup barbeque sauce
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 cup jicama, peeled and diced
- 2  red bell peppers, seeded and diced
- 2  orange bell peppers, seeded and diced
- 2 (15.25 ounce) cans whole kernel corn, drained
- ¾ cup minced fresh cilantro
- 2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained
- 2  jalapeno peppers, seeded and chopped (wear gloves)  (Optional)
- 1  red onion, chopped  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken breasts into a saucepan over medium-low heat, and pour in 1 cup of barbeque sauce.
2. Simmer the chicken until the meat is no longer pink inside, about 15 minutes.
3. Allow to cool, and dice chicken meat.
4. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
5. Once the water is boiling, stir in the shell pasta, and return to a boil.
6. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.
7. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
8. Rinse pasta with cold water until chilled, and drain again thoroughly.
9. In a large salad bowl, whisk 1 cup of barbeque sauce with mayonnaise until thoroughly combined.
10. Mix in the cumin, then stir in cooked chicken.
11. Place cooked pasta, jicama, red and orange bell peppers, corn, cilantro, black beans, jalapeno peppers, and red onion into the salad bowl, and gently fold to combine with the dressing.
12. Serve warm or chilled.
