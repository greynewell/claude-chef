## Ingredients

- 3 cups fresh orange juice, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 3 pounds trimmed skirt steaks
- 16 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, or as needed
- 1  white onion, chopped, or to taste
- 1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Combine orange juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne in a large freezer bag. Submerge skirt steaks in the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate, 1 to 8 hours.
2. Preheat a grill to medium-high. Grill the steaks until hot and firm in the center or to your preferred doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a flat work surface and slice as thinly as possible against the grain.
3. Heat corn tortillas on the grill or in a microwave. Keep tortillas warm in a folded sheet of aluminum foil covered by a thick towel.
4. Add steak to each tortilla and top with white onion and cilantro.
