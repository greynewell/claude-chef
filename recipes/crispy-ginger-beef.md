## Ingredients

- ¾ cup cornstarch
- ½ cup water
- 2  eggs
- 1 pound flank steak, cut into thin strips
- ½ cup canola oil, or as needed
- 1 large carrot, cut into matchstick-size pieces
- 1  green bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into matchstick-size pieces
- 3  green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup minced fresh ginger root
- 5  garlic cloves, minced
- ½ cup white sugar
- ¼ cup rice vinegar
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place cornstarch in a large bowl; gradually whisk in water until smooth. Whisk eggs into cornstarch mixture; toss steak strips in mixture to coat.
2. Pour canola oil into a wok, 1-inch deep; heat oil over high heat until hot but not smoking. Place 1/4 of the beef strips into hot oil; separate strips with a fork. Cook, stirring frequently, until coating is crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Remove beef to drain on paper towels; repeat with remaining beef.
3. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon oil; cook and stir carrot, bell peppers, green onions, ginger, and garlic over high heat until lightly browned but still crisp, about 3 minutes.
4. Whisk sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes together in a small bowl. Pour sauce mixture over vegetables in wok; bring mixture to a boil. Stir beef back into vegetable mixture; cook and stir just until heated through, about 3 minutes.
