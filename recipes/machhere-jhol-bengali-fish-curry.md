## Ingredients

- 2 large tomatoes, coarsely chopped
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 cups water
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 pounds thick whitefish fillets, cut into large chunks
- ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
- ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
- ½ teaspoon black cumin seeds
- ¼ teaspoon fennel seeds, lightly crushed
- ¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds

## Instructions

1. Bring the tomatoes, cumin, turmeric, salt, and water to a boil in a four quart saucepan; reduce heat to medium and maintain a simmer.
2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook the fish in the oiled skillet until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to the saucepan.
3. Heat a separate skillet over medium heat, and toast the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, black cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and fenugreek seeds until fragrant, just a few seconds. Stir the spices into the saucepan. Simmer until the flavors integrate, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.
