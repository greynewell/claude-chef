## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon oil, or as needed
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅓ cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon
- 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 ½ cups white sugar
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract
- ¼ cup plain Greek yogurt

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®) with oil. Mix sugar and cinnamon together; sprinkle into the pan, coating the sides and center evenly. Set aside.
2. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together for the filling. Set aside.
3. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cream of tartar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined.
4. Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in pumpkin puree and vanilla extract until thoroughly incorporated. Add 1/2 of the flour mixture; mix until just combined. Mix in Greek yogurt until combined. Add in remaining flour mixture, mixing until just combined.
5. Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of the filling over the batter. Repeat layers once more, then add the last 1/3 of the batter. Smooth gently over the filling, ensuring it is completely covered.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Gently run a butter knife around the edges and center of the pan to loosen, then invert cake onto a wire rack to cool completely.
