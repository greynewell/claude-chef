## Ingredients

- 1  beef bouillon cube
- ⅓ cup boiling water
- 5 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon teriyaki sauce
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 pound beef round steak, cut into thin strips
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen stir-fry vegetables

## Instructions

1. Dissolve beef bouillon cube in boiling water in a large bowl. Stir soy sauce, cornstarch, teriyaki sauce, and sugar into the water. Lay beef strips into the soy sauce mixture; stir to coat beef entirely.

Remove vegetable mixture with a slotted spoon to a large bowl, reserving juices in the skillet.
