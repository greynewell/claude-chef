## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- ⅔ cup water
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
- 1  green chile pepper, chopped
- 1 (1 1/2 inch) piece ginger, grated
- 2  onions, peeled and finely chopped
- 10  fresh curry leaves
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- sea salt to taste
- 6 ounces uncooked prawns, peeled and deveined
- 2  eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. To make the dough, place the flour into a mixing bowl.
2. Gradually stir in 1/4 cup vegetable oil and the water to make a soft, pliable dough.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth, about 4 minutes.
4. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside for 1 hour.
5. Heat 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat.
6. Sprinkle in the mustard seeds; when the seeds start to pop, stir in the green chile, ginger, onions, and curry leaves.
7. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes.
8. Add the turmeric and a pinch of salt and cook for 1 minute more.
9. Mix in the prawns and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, 2 to 3 minutes.
10. Remove from the heat and set aside.
11. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
12. Place one piece in the palm of your hands and roll it into a smooth ball.
13. Lightly dust with flour, then place it on work surface and roll out the dough into a paper-thin round about 8 1/2 inches (22 cm) in diameter.
14. Repeat with the remaining dough.
15. Heat a cast iron skillet or heavy frying pan over medium heat.
16. Brush the skillet with oil or use cooking spray.
17. Stir the beaten eggs into the prawn filling mixture.
18. Place a circle of dough into the preheated skillet.
19. Spread 3 tablespoons of filling over the dough.
20. Cook until the bottom of the bread has browned, about 5 minutes.
21. Lower the heat and carefully turn the paratha over with a spatula.
22. Cook for an additional 5 minutes so the prawn mixture is well stuck to the paratha.
23. Flip the paratha over again and transfer it to a cutting board.
24. Roll the paratha into a cylinder shape to enclose the filling.
25. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
26. Cut each stuffed paratha in half to serve.
