## Ingredients

- 4 (4 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
- ½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 medium head napa cabbage, thinly sliced
- ¼ medium head green cabbage, thinly sliced
- 1 medium carrot, shredded
- ½ cup crispy fried rice noodles

## Instructions

1. Place chicken in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger for marinade together in a small bowl; pour over chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Combine mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and ginger for dressing in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate while you cook the chicken.
4. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
5. Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the grill and chop when cool enough to handle.
6. While the chicken is cooking, place sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium-high heat. Shake the pan like you are making popcorn and toast until seeds give off a lovely toasted smell, 3 to 5 minutes. Quickly remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool; if you leave them in the pan they will continue to cook and burn.
7. Place napa cabbage, green cabbage, and carrot in a large bowl with chicken and toasted sesame seeds. Toss together, then mix in the dressing. Divide salad onto plates and top with crispy fried noodles.
