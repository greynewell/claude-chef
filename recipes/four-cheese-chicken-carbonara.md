## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon
- 1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta
- ⅓ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup butter
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- 3 teaspoons ground black pepper, divided
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, sliced
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup grated Parmesan-Romano cheese blend
- 1 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese blend
- 3  eggs, beaten

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Chop into small pieces when cool enough to handle.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and olive oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
3. While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large, deep skillet over low heat. Add chopped bacon, garlic, and 1 teaspoon pepper; saute until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium, add chicken, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Add whipping cream, Parmesan-Romano cheese, and remaining 2 teaspoons pepper to the skillet. Stir and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Add Colby Jack cheese and stir until melted. Stir in beaten eggs and bring to a simmer. Add drained pasta, stir until coated with sauce, and serve immediately.
