## Ingredients

- 4 (8 ounce) salmon fillets
- 4 cups chopped fresh spinach
- ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped
- ½ cup artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Make a horizontal slice in the center of each salmon fillet but do not cut all the way through.
2. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spinach and cook uncovered until tender, about 40 seconds. Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain thoroughly and transfer to a bowl.
3. Add sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, and feta cheese to the blanched spinach; mix to combine. Divide evenly and stuff into the salmon "pockets." Season fillets with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
4. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Place salmon fillets, skin-sides down, in the hot skillet and sear for 5 minutes. Gently flip and sear the other sides for 5 minutes. Flip again to finish cooking, about 5 minutes more.
