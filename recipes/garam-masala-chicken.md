## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 (3 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 bunch green onions, chopped
- 1 ½ cups chopped tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ cup water
- 2 teaspoons garam masala, divided

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken breasts in the hot oil and cook until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip the chicken and add the onions; cook another 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, garlic salt, and water to the chicken; stir. Season with 1 1/2 teaspoon garam masala. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Stir the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garam masala through the mixture. Raise heat to medium and bring mixture to a boil. Cook until the chicken no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
