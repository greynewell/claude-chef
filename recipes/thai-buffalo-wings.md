## Ingredients

- 15  chicken wings
- ½ cup all-purpose flour
- oil for deep frying
- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)
- 1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
- ½ teaspoon Thai red chile paste
- 2 tablespoons Asian sweet chile sauce (such as Mae Ploy® Sweet Chilli Sauce)
- 2 tablespoons honey

## Instructions

1. Toss chicken wings with the flour in a large non-porous bowl to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 60 to 90 minutes.
2. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Combine butter, hot pepper sauce, chile-garlic sauce, Thai red chile paste, Asian sweet chile sauce, and honey in a small saucepan over low heat. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter is melted completely and the sauce is well blended, about 5 minutes; set aside.
4. Fry the chicken wings in the hot oil until they become golden brown and are no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken wings to a serving bowl.
5. Pour the sauce over the chicken wings; stir to coat.
