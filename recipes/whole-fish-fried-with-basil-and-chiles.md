## Ingredients

- 1 whole (10 ounce) tilapia, or more as desired
- oil for deep frying
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as desired
- 1  yellow onion, chopped
- 5  large red chile peppers, sliced
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons light soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Cut several angled slits along the body of the fish, cutting down to the rib bones.
2. Cut 2 lateral slits along the back of the fish, from head to tail on either side of the dorsal fin.

6. Gently remove fish from the oil and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
7. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, red chile peppers, and garlic until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes.
8. Add fish sauce and soy sauce and remove wok from heat.
9. Quickly stir basil and cilantro into sauce.
10. Place fish on a large serving platter and pour sauce over fish.
