## Ingredients

- 10  carrots, ends trimmed to make hot dog-size shape
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup water
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- ¼ cup sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add carrots, cover, and steam until tender yet still have a snap, about 15 minutes. Run cold water over carrots to stop the cooking process. Transfer carrots to a storage container.
