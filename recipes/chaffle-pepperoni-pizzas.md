## Ingredients

- aluminum foil
- ¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 large egg
- 1 tablespoon almond flour
- ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
- ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 4 tablespoons no-sugar-added marinara sauce (such as Newman's Own®)
- 6 slices pepperoni, quartered
- 1 pinch dried basil  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high broil. Preheat a mini waffle iron. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
2. Combine 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, almond flour, oregano, basil, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes in a bowl.
3. Pour 1/2 of the batter onto the preheated waffle iron, spreading out with a spoon. Close the waffle iron, and cook until the steaming stops and the chaffle is well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer chaffle to the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining batter.
4. Divide marinara sauce between the 2 chaffles, sprinkle with remaining mozzarella, place pepperoni on top, and sprinkle with basil.
5. Broil in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and is bubbling, about 1 minute, watching carefully so they don't burn.
