## Ingredients

- 1 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- ½ cup olive oil
- 2 (16 ounce) t-bone steaks

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a broiler pan.
2. Stir bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, and garlic powder together in a shallow dish, such as a pie plate. Pour olive oil into a separate shallow dish. Dip t-bone steaks in olive oil on both sides; allow excess to drip off. Press steaks into bread crumb mixture, and place onto the prepared broiler pan.
3. Bake on the middle rack in the preheated oven until steaks have cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 15 minutes for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center for medium should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
