1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

10. Turn mixture out onto the center of the prepared pizza pan.
11. Form into a ball, then use palms of hands to gradually press into a flat 8-inch circle.
12. Use fingertips to create a smooth, slightly thicker outer edge.
13. Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until top begins to turn golden brown, 16 to 17 minutes.
14. Remove from oven and use a spatula to loosen paper.
15. Flip crust and return to oven until golden, 5 to 6 minutes more.
16. Combine olive oil, garlic, basil, and salt in a bowl.
17. Spread sauce on top of baked crust.
18. Top sauce with mozzarella cheese, bruschetta sauce, and feta cheese.
