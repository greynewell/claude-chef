## Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt
- ½ cup organic cane sugar
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 ½ teaspoons lemon zest, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ½ cups chopped fresh strawberries
- ⅓ cup sliced almonds, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and line a 12-cup standard muffin tin.
2. Combine oats, yogurt, sugar, oil, eggs, lemon juice, baking powder, lemon zest, vanilla extract, almond extract, baking soda, cardamom, and salt in a blender. Blend on high speed until mixture is fairly smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Either pour batter into a bowl and mix strawberries and almonds in by hand, or add the chopped strawberries and almonds to the blender and pulse just a few times to evenly distribute.
3. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until muffins spring back lightly when touched, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow muffins to cool a few minutes in the pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
