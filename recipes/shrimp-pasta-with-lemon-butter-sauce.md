## Ingredients

- ½ (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
- 1 ½ medium lemons
- 1 cup chicken stock, or more as needed
- 2 tablespoons salted butter, divided
- 1 pound uncooked shrimp, shelled and deveined
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 medium tomatoes, cubed
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Slice the whole lemon into circles, then cut circles in half. Juice the remaining half lemon and set aside.
3. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough chicken stock to cover the bottom of the skillet. Add 1 tablespoon butter with shrimp and lemon slices. Add parsley, salt, and pepper; cook shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 4 minutes. Turn heat off, add tomatoes, and cover with a lid until the heat softens the tomatoes.
4. Drain pasta and return to its pan. Add shrimp and tomato mixture and mix to combine. You may take out the lemon slices and squeeze the juice out of them or simply keep them mixed in.
5. Add more chicken stock to cover the bottom of the skillet. Add 1 tablespoon butter, more parsley, and the reserved lemon juice. Let the butter melt and simmer, then pour sauce into the pasta along with Parmesan cheese. Stir until fully combined.
