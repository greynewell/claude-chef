## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed
- 1 large slice of onion
- 4  green serrano chiles, or to taste
- 1 clove garlic
- ½ cup water
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup shredded Chihuahua cheese
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, or to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed
- 12  corn tortillas
- 1  cooked chicken breast, shredded
- 1 cup shredded Chihuahua cheese

## Instructions

1. Line a griddle or large frying pan with aluminum foil. Heat over medium-high heat. Add tomatillos, onion, chiles, and garlic. Grill until charred, 7 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally to cook evenly. Allow vegetables to cool slightly.
2. Transfer grilled vegetables to a blender with water, cream and 1/2 cup Chihuahua cheese; blend until smooth. Season with chicken bouillon granules; add additional water to thin sauce, if necessary,
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Heat a small drizzle of oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Fry tortillas in hot oil for a few seconds, one by one, until soft but not crispy. Add more oil as needed. Place cooked tortillas on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.
5. Pour 1/3 the sauce into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Fill tortillas with equal amounts of shredded chicken, roll up, and arrange in a single layer over the sauce. Pour remaining sauce on top and cover with remaining 1 cup mild Cheddar cheese.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until melted, about 25 minutes.
