## Ingredients

- 2 medium zucchini
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 pound lean ground chicken
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon oregano
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup low-fat sour cream
- ½ cup pico de gallo
- 1  jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced  (Optional)
- 3  green onions, green parts chopped

## Instructions

1. Cut zucchini into 1/4-inch slices using a mandoline slicer. Place slices in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat. Let drain for 30 minutes. Place slices on a clean kitchen towel and pat dry.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12x18-inch baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned, breaking meat up into small crumbles, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain and discard any accumulated liquid.
4. Return skillet to low heat and stir in chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, salt, oregano, and black pepper. Keep warm.
5. Place zucchini slices on the prepared baking pan in a single layer.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.
7. Remove zucchini from oven and top with chicken mixture and shredded Cheddar cheese. Return to the hot oven and bake until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.
8. Top nachos with dollops of sour cream, pico de gallo, jalapeno, and green onions. Serve immediately.
