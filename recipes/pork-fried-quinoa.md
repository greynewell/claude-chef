## Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 1 ½ cups cold water
- salt to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup cubed fully cooked ham
- ½ cup diced red bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped green onion, white and green parts separated
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®), or more to taste  (Optional)
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Rinse quinoa in cold water for about 1 minute and drain well.
2. Place in a saucepan and cover with 1 1/2 cup cold water and salt. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes.
3. Fluff quinoa with a fork and set aside.
4. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ham, red bell pepper, and the white parts of the green onion until the ham begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Set chopped green onion tops aside. Add garlic, remove from heat, and stir until garlic becomes aromatic, 1 or 2 minutes.
5. Stir in quinoa and return to stove over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar, soy sauce, chile-garlic sauce, and sesame seeds. Garnish with reserved green onion tops.
