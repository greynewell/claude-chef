## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying
- ½ cup finely chopped green onions
- ½ cup finely chopped cabbage
- ½ cup finely chopped carrot
- ½ cup minced garlic
- 4 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
- ½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (such as Ac'cent®)
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  eggs
- 1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat.
3. Mix green onions, cabbage, carrot, garlic, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, monosodium glutamate, salt, and pepper into ground beef mixture; cook and stir until liquid is evaporated and vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to a bowl and mix in 1 egg.
4. Crack the second egg into a bowl and beat well.
5. Hold 1 wonton wrapper in the palm of your hand and brush a thin layer of beaten egg on 1 edge. Scoop about 1 teaspoon beef mixture into the center of the wrapper. Fold wrapper in half, corner to corner, to make a triangle and pinch the edges shut, crimping with your fingers to make a seal. Press the air out by cupping your fingers over the dumpling in your palm and pressing lightly.
6. Fry wontons in the hot oil until 1 side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer wontons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain using a slotted spoon.
7. Whisk soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds together in a bowl until dipping sauce is smooth. Serve alongside wontons.
