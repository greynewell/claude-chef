## Ingredients

- 5 medium scallions, trimmed
- 1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained
- ½ pound cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 pound lean ground turkey
- 1 large clove garlic, pressed
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon chopped ginger
- 2 (16 ounce) packages wonton wrappers

## Instructions

1. Cut scallions in half; slice green tops and set aside. Add white and light green parts of scallions to the bowl of a food processor with water chestnuts; pulse until finely chopped. Empty mixture into a large mixing bowl.
2. Place cooked shrimp into the food processor and pulse until cut into tiny pieces. Add cut shrimp, ground turkey, pressed garlic, flour, soy sauce, and ginger to the large mixing bowl with the scallion mixture. Blend all ingredients thoroughly using your hands.
3. Place about 1 teaspoon of the meat mixture onto a wonton wrapper. Wet your finger in a small dish of water and moisten the outer edges of the wrapper. Fold and pinch the edges so that the meat will not come out when cooking. Repeat to make remaining dumplings.
4. Bring a pot of water to a boil; add dumplings, working in batches, and cook until they float to the top and turkey is no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve.
