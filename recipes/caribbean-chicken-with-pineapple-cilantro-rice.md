## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 (8 ounce) can sliced pineapple in juice, drained - divided
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 pinch garlic salt
- 1 pinch ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Mix together the light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, thyme, cumin, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, paprika, chili powder, and nutmeg in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Rub both sides of chicken breasts with the spice mixture, and place into a 9x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle any remaining seasoning mix on top of chicken, if desired.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is lightly browned, no longer pink inside, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chicken breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
4. While chicken is baking, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
5. Chop half the pineapple slices. Mix the chopped pineapple, cilantro, and olive oil into the cooked rice, and season to taste with a pinch or two of garlic salt and black pepper. Fluff the rice up with a fork, and transfer to a serving platter. Serve with the baked chicken, topped with remaining pineapple slices.
