## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons minced fresh serrano chili
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- ¼ cup finely diced white onion
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt for grinding vegetables, plus more to taste
- 4 large Hass avocados
- 1 cup diced ripe tomatoes, drained  (Optional)
- 1  lime, juiced, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Place minced peppers, 1/4 cup of the chopped cilantro, and the diced onions on a cutting board. Chop them together into very small pieces. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Using the flat side of the knife blade, smear the mixture to work it into a paste, and chop again to achieve as fine a texture as possible.

Mash with a potato masher to desired texture (smooth or chunky), 5 or 6 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. If not serving immediately, cover and refrigerate.
