## Ingredients

- ¾ cup teriyaki sauce
- ⅔ cup dry sherry
- 4 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 6 (6 ounce) swordfish steaks

## Instructions

1. In a large saucepan combine teriyaki sauce, sherry, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Bring to a boil. Set the marinade aside to cool for 10 minutes.
2. Place fish in a shallow baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over the fish. Flip the fish over and pour the remaining marinade on the fish. Coat entire fish with marinade. Refrigerate the fish for 1 1/2 hours, turning the fish over often.
