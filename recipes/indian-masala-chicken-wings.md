## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ teaspoon hot chile powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1 teaspoon salt, or more as needed
- 5 large chicken wings, cut in 2, tips discarded

## Instructions

1. Combine coriander, cumin, cardamom, chile powder, pepper, and cloves in a dry pan over low heat. Stir until fragrant. Remove from heat, add oil and water, and stir until combined. Set spice paste aside.
2. Rub salt over wings in a shallow dish, then rub spice paste all over. Cover and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
