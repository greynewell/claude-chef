## Ingredients

- ½ pound ground pork
- 1 (4 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and chopped
- 1 (4 ounce) can shiitake mushrooms, drained and chopped
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce
- 1 (12 ounce) package round dumpling wrappers

## Instructions

1. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Combine ground pork, water chestnuts, shiitake mushrooms, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until pork is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
3. Lay out 8 dumpling wrappers on a clean work surface. Place a heaping teaspoonful of the pork mixture in the middle of each wrapper. Pull both sides up like a taco and pinch the tops until sealed.
4. Cook in batches in the pre-heated air fryer for 3 minutes. Use tongs to flip the potstickers and cook 3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate.
5. Repeat Step 3 to form more dumplings while each batch is cooking.
