## Ingredients

- 12 (6 inch) bamboo skewers
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup mirin
- ⅛ cup sake
- ⅛ cup water
- 1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar
- ¼  green onion, sliced diagonally
- ¾ pound chicken skin, cut into 1 1/2-inch wide strips
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Soak skewers in water for at least 30 minutes to overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, water, brown sugar, and green onion in a saucepan. Bring to a light boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until sauce has reduced slightly, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.
4. Meanwhile, thread chicken skin onto skewers lengthwise; skin should be slightly bunched up, but not too taut. Sprinkle skewers with salt.
5. Cook skewers on the preheated grill until nicely browned and crispy but not until fat has completely rendered, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until other side is crispy, about 5 minutes more.
6. Blot each yakitori lightly with a paper towel before serving. Serve with cooled tare sauce on the side.
