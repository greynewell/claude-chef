## Ingredients

- 4 (8 ounce) containers tofu
- ½ cup prawns - peeled, deveined, and minced
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 ½ ounces ground chicken
- 1  green onion, chopped
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- salt and ground white pepper to taste
- 1  egg
- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- cold water, or as needed
- ⅓ cup water
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped dry roasted peanuts
- 1  fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Slice each tofu square diagonally to make 8 triangles. Make a cut into the base of each tofu triangle and scoop out enough of tofu to create a pocket.
2. Combine scooped-out tofu pieces, prawns, egg, ground chicken, green onion, cornstarch, sesame oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl for the filling. Carefully stuff filling back into the tofu triangles; the filling will bulge out.
3. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add stuffed tofu triangles, cover, and steam for 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, make the batter. Mix egg and flour in a bowl. Whisk in enough water to give batter a medium-thin consistency.
5. Combine water, peanuts, red chile pepper, garlic, vinegar, salt, and sugar in a bowl. Stir until salt and sugar have dissolved and set sauce aside.
6. Remove cooked tofu triangles from the steamer.
7. Heat oil in a wok until hot. Dip triangles into the batter and slowly lower into the hot oil. Fry in batches until golden brown and the batter is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with the peanut sauce.
