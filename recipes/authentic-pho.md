## Ingredients

- 4 pounds beef soup bones
- 1  onion, unpeeled and cut in half
- 5 slices fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 pods star anise
- 2 ½ tablespoons fish sauce
- 4 quarts water
- 1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles
- 1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced
- ½ cup chopped cilantro
- 1 tablespoon chopped green onion
- 1 ½ cups bean sprouts
- 1 bunch Thai basil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.
3. Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
4. Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.
5. Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.
6. When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.
7. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.
8. Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.
9. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.
