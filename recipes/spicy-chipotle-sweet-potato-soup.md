## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large yellow onion, chopped
- 3 ½ pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks
- 4 ½ cups vegetable broth, or as needed
- 1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 2  limes, juiced
- salt to taste
- 1 cup sour cream
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add sweet potatoes and enough vegetable broth to cover sweet potatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, partially cover saucepan, and simmer until sweet potatoes are tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, about 30 minutes.
2. Stir chipotle peppers into the sweet potato mixture.

4. Serve each portion of soup topped with 2 tablespoons sour cream and a sprinkle of cilantro.
