## Ingredients

- 4 slices bacon, or more to taste
- 4 slices sturdy white bread
- 6 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 tablespoons salted butter
- 2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets
- 1 pinch salt to taste
- 1 pinch seasoned salt (such as Lawry's® Mediterranean Herb)
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons pesto
- 4 leaves Bibb lettuce
- 4 slices tomato
- 2 slices Havarti cheese

## Instructions

1. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and extra crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.
3. While the bacon is cooking, place bread on a baking sheet and use a pastry brush to lightly coat the tops with olive oil.
4. Toast bread, without turning, under the preheated broiler until crispy (like a crouton), about 4 minutes, watching carefully as it toasts. Remove from the oven and set aside.
5. Add remaining oil to a large skillet with butter. Season salmon with salt and place skin-side down in the hot pan. Cook until skin is crispy and salmon is nearly cooked through, about 6 minutes. Flip and cook until top side of fish is just browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the pan, discard skins, and sprinkle with seasoned salt.
6. Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on the untoasted side of a bread slice. Top with 1 salmon fillet, 1 tablespoon pesto, 2 lettuce leaves, 2 tomato slices, 2 slices bacon, 1 slice Havarti cheese, and a slice of bread, toasted-side out. Repeat to assemble remaining sandwich.
