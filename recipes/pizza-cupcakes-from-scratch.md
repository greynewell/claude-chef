## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ cup milk
- 2 tablespoons milk
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 ½ ounces diced pepperoni
- ½ cup pizza sauce, for dipping

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 9 wells in a cupcake tin with nonstick cooking spray, or line with paper liners (spray the liners with nonstick cooking spray).
2. Combine flour, sugar, salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and baking powder in a bowl. Whisk to combine and make a well in the center.

4. Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are lightly browned and baked through, 13 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pan for 1 to 2 minutes, then move to a cooling rack. Serve warm with pizza sauce for dipping if desired.
