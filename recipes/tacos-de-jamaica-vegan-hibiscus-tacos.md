## Ingredients

- 8 ounces dried hibiscus flowers
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 10  fresh tomatillos, husks removed
- 1  avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced
- ¼  onion, chopped
- 2  serrano peppers

## Instructions

1. Rinse hibiscus very well to make sure all dust is removed. Place clean hibiscus in a pot over medium heat, cover with water, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove hibiscus from heat and allow to steep for at least 2 hours, until hibiscus is very soft. Drain well.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook 1 onion and 2 cloves garlic until soft and translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in drained hibiscus and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, until hibiscus turns a deep red color.
3. Combine tomatillos, avocado, 1/4 onion, serrano peppers, 1 clove garlic, and 2 tablespoons cilantro; blend until smooth. Season salsa verde with salt.
4. Warm corn tortillas in a skillet. Divide hibiscus mixture amongst tortillas and top with pineapple, onion, and cilantro. Serve with salsa verde and lime.
