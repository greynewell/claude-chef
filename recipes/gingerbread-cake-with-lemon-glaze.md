## Ingredients

- 1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 ¼ teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
- ½ cup white sugar
- ½ cup dark molasses
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1  egg, beaten
- ½ cup boiling water
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- ¼ cup lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 9-inch square baking pan.
