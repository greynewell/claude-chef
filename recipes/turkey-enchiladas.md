## Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded Cheddar and Monterey cheese blend
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 (2 ounce) can sliced black olives
- 24 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- 1 (19 ounce) can red enchilada sauce
- 4 cups cooked turkey, chopped

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce into a bowl.
2. Combine Cheddar-Jack cheese, onion, and black olives in a small bowl.
3. Brush a small skillet with enough oil to coat a tortilla, and heat over low heat. Add tortilla and cook until soft, 15 to 30 seconds per side. Remove and dip in enchilada sauce to coat, then place on a plate. Place some turkey amd some cheese mixture in the center of the tortilla, roll up, and place it in the prepared baking dish.
4. Repeat Step 3, using more oil as needed, to form and roll 11 more enchiladas; they should cover the bottom of the baking dish.
5. Spread enchilada sauce over the enchiladas to cover. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 to form, roll, and place remaining 12 enchiladas. Spread remaining sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining cheese mixture.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.
