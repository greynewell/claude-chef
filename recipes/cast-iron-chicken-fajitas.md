## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chipotle chile powder
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
- 2 medium bell peppers, sliced
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 medium lime, juiced
- 16 (8 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

## Instructions

1. Dry chicken with paper towels and pound to a uniform thickness of 1/2 to 3/4-inch thickness.
2. Combine cumin, chipotle chili powder, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, coriander, garlic, Mexican oregano, and pepper in a bowl. Divide spice mixture in half. Sprinkle chicken with 1/2 of the spice mixture and rub on both sides of the chicken. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours.
3. Combine bell pepper slices, onion slices, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Stir vegetables until coated in oil, then sprinkle reserved spice mix over the vegetables. Stir until evenly coated; set aside.
4. Heat a dry 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Pour remaining 2 tablespoons oil into the hot skillet. Add chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until the chicken is nicely browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board.
5. Add seasoned vegetables to the same skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
6. While vegetables are cooking, slice the chicken breasts into 1/2-inch slices, and add back to the skillet to continue cooking. Continue stirring and cooking until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
7. Remove skillet from heat and drizzle lime juice over all. Give one final stir and serve in warm flour tortillas.
