## Ingredients

- ¼ cup ancho chile powder
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chipotle chile powder
- ⅔ cup canola oil, or more as needed
- 1 large lime, juiced
- 8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions

1. Combine ancho chile powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and chipotle powder in a medium glass or ceramic bowl. Whisk in canola oil and lime juice until well-combined; thin with additional canola oil if mixture seems too thick.
2. Arrange chicken in a glass or ceramic baking dish; pour marinade over chicken, covering it completely. Marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
4. Arrange chicken on the baking sheet; do not crowd. Discard any excess marinade.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 to 6 minutes.
