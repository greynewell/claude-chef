## Ingredients

- ½ cup sour cream
- ½  avocado, peeled and pitted
- ½  lemon, juiced
- 1 pound small Gulf shrimp (50 to 60 per pound), thawed and drained
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ¼ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 50  large (restaurant-style) tortilla chips, or as needed
- 2  jalapeno peppers, seeded and very thinly sliced
- 3 ½ cups shredded pepperjack cheese, or as needed
- 15  cherry tomatoes, sliced - or as needed
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Combine sour cream, avocado, and lemon juice in a blender or food processor; blend until smooth and creamy. Transfer into a plastic decorating bottle with a long tip. Refrigerate avocado-cream sauce until needed.
2. Place shrimp into a bowl; combine with vegetable oil, ground chipotle pepper, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
3. Place a large nonstick pan over high heat. Cook shrimp in the hot pan in a single layer until barely cooked through and pink, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and let shrimp cool.
4. Preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease the foil.
5. Lay tortilla chips onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Place 1 shrimp onto each chip. Add 1 slice jalapeno and 1 large pinch pepperjack cheese on top of each shrimp.
6. Broil under preheated broiler until cheese is melted and chips are lightly toasted, about 1 minute. Watch carefully; chips will burn quickly.
7. Remove nachos from baking sheet and arrange onto a serving platter; drizzle with avocado-cream sauce and sprinkle with cherry tomatoes and cilantro before serving.
