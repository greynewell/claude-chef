## Ingredients

- 3 pounds top round roast
- 1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing
- 1  onion, thinly sliced
- 8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2 (1 pound) loaves French bread
- 1 pound processed cheese food (eg. Velveeta), cubed
- 1 cup salsa
- ¼ cup chopped jalapeno stuffed green olives

## Instructions

1. Place the top round and entire bottle of salad dressing in a resealable plastic bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours.
2. When meat is fully marinated and you're ready to prepare sandwiches, preheat oven to broil.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the onions and mushrooms in the butter or margarine for 10 minutes, or until onions are tender. Set aside.
4. Broil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove from oven and slice thinly against the grain. Place slices evenly on the bread and cover with the onion mixture.
5. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the cheese, salsa and olives. Microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on high, or until the cheese is melted. Stir well and serve with the sandwiches.
