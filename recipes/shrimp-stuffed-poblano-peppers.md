## Instructions

1. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
2. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
3. Cook peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes.
4. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
5. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes.
6. While peppers are steaming, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
7. Cut cooled peppers in 1/2; remove and discard skins.
8. Place peppers, cut-sides down, in an ungreased 10x15-inch baking pan.
9. Brush with 1 tablespoon melted butter; sprinkle with pepper and salt.
10. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
11. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.
12. Turn peppers over in the baking pan so the cut-sides are facing up.
13. Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
14. Add onion and celery; saute until tender, about 5 minutes.
15. Add cream cheese and stir until melted.
16. Add cooked shrimp, shredded Mexican cheese blend, cooked rice, lemon juice, cilantro, onion powder, and garlic powder.
17. Cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
18. Spoon shrimp and rice mixture into pepper halves.
19. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and 2 tablespoons melted butter for the topping.
20. Sprinkle over peppers.
21. Return to the preheated oven and bake, uncovered, until topping is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
