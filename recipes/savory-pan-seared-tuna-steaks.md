## Ingredients

- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons molasses
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- 6  thin slices fresh ginger, minced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  1-inch-thick tuna steaks, thawed

## Instructions

1. Mix together soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, sesame oil, molasses, cayenne pepper, ginger, and garlic in a bowl.
2. Place tuna steaks in a large resealable plastic bag or airtight container; pour marinade over steaks. Marinate steaks at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat.
4. Remove steaks from marinade and arrange in the hot pan; gently shake the pan to avoid sticking. Cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until desired doneness is reached, 1 to 2 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare.
