## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon chipotle hot sauce (such as Cholula®)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced ginger
- 1 teaspoon agave syrup
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil

- ½ tablespoon ground black pepper
- 1 (8 ounce) package coleslaw mix
- ½  red bell pepper, diced

## Instructions
