## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 2 (5 ounce) cod fillets
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
- 2 medium limes, zested and juiced

## Instructions

1. Combine paprika, parsley, oregano, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Brush cod fillets with 1 tablespoon olive oil; rub with the spice mixture. Use all of the spice mixture and make sure they are well coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.

3. Cook in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily and is opaque throughout, 10 to 12 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, melt ghee with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a small saucepan. Add lime zest and juice and swirl the pan to mix. Serve the cod topped with the lime butter.
