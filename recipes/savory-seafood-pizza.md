## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough

- 10  pitted black olives, halved

## Instructions

1. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray.
2. Coat pizza dough with spray and rosemary; place into the bowl.
3. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

6. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
7. Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
8. Mix in flour until creamy.

11. Remove sauce from heat; cool until just slightly warm, at least 8 minutes.
12. Spread sauce onto the pizza dough to form a thin, even layer.
13. Cover with pieces of crab meat; layer 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, zucchini, mushrooms, and olives on top.
14. Cover with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
