## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut into chunks
- 1 pound tomatoes, chopped
- 4 cups water
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 4 medium jalapeno peppers, diced
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 5 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 medium limes, juiced
- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 12 (6 inch) flour tortillas, warmed

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat. Add beef and saute, working in batches if needed, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, onion, jalapenos, 1/2 cup cilantro, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer and cook until meat is tender, about 2 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.
3. Remove beef from the pot, shred with 2 forks, and toss with remaining cilantro, lime juice, and more salt and pepper.
4. Take each tortilla and place 2 tablespoons of the shredded beef and some Monterey Jack cheese into it. Roll tightly and place on the prepared cookie sheet.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until flautas are golden and crisp, about 15 minutes, turning once halfway through. Remove from the oven and cut in half before serving.
