## Ingredients

- Dipping Sauce:
- 1 clove garlic, minced, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar, or more to taste
- 1 teaspoon tomato paste
- ¼ teaspoon ground chipotle peppers
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste
- Spice Blend:
- 1 tablespoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground chipotle peppers
- 2 quarts cold water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2  bay leaves
- 2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 cups vegetable oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Make dipping sauce: Combine garlic, smoked paprika, and salt in a mortar and pestle or food processor; process until smooth. Mix in mayonnaise, sherry vinegar, tomato paste, chipotle chile powder, and cayenne pepper until combined. Cover and refrigerate sauce.
2. Make spice blend: Mix together salt, black pepper, paprika, and chipotle chile powder in a small bowl. Set aside.
3. Make potatoes: Pour water into a large saucepan. Stir salt, smoked paprika, cumin, and bay leaves into water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover; simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Stir potatoes into seasoned water, bring to a boil, and simmer until potatoes are tender but not fully cooked, 4 to 5 minutes. The tip of a paring knife should easily insert into the center of a potato cube. Drain potatoes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
6. Add cooled potato cubes and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to cool slightly. Toss in a bowl with spice blend and serve with dipping sauce.
