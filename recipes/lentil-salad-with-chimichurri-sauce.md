## Ingredients

- 1 pound lentils
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- salt to taste
- 1 cup chopped fresh parsley
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add lentils, cover, and steam, adding more water as needed, until tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer cooked lentils to a serving bowl.
2. Blend oil, vinegar, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and salt in a blender until well incorporated. Add parsley and cilantro; pulse only long enough to incorporate the herbs.
3. Drizzle 3 tablespoons chimichurri sauce over lentils; add feta cheese to salad. Toss to evenly coat. Store remaining sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for another use.
