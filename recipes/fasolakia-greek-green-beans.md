- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 small onion, grated
- 1 ½ pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
- 4  tomatoes, pureed
- 2  yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pinch white sugar  (Optional)

Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes. Add puréed tomatoes, potatoes, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir well, then add enough water to barely cover beans.
