## Ingredients

- 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
- 3  egg yolks
- 1  large egg
- 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon fine salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- ⅛ teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder
- 1  9-inch unbaked pie crust (see footnote for recipe link)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Whisk together pumpkin, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined.
3. Line a 9-inch pie plate with pie crust; crimp edges.
