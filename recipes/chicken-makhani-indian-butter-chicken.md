## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon peanut oil
- 1  shallot, finely chopped
- ¼  white onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1  bay leaf
- ¼ cup plain yogurt
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 1 cup tomato puree
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch black pepper
- 1 tablespoon peanut oil
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ¼ cup water

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to stir frequently.
3. Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
5. Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce and stir together.
6. Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
