## Ingredients

- 6  lasagna noodles
- 1 pound extra-lean ground beef
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon dried chives
- ⅛ teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 pinch ground nutmeg
- 2 cups shredded yellow and white marbled Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) package light cream cheese, softened

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through, about 8 minutes. Drain and pat noodles dry with paper towels.
3. Brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking the meat into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Pour pasta sauce into beef mixture and stir garlic powder, basil, parsley, chives, oregano, and nutmeg into beef and sauce.
4. Spread half of the beef sauce into a 2-quart casserole dish and sprinkle with 1 cup Cheddar cheese.
5. Lay a lasagna noodle out onto a lightly floured work surface and spread with 2 tablespoons cream cheese. Spread 2 tablespoons ground beef sauce onto noodle; roll noodle and place with seam side down atop cheese in casserole dish. Repeat with remaining noodles. Sprinkle remaining beef sauce and 1 cup Cheddar cheese over noodle rolls.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese and sauce bubble, 10 to 15 minutes.
