## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- ⅓ cup teriyaki sauce
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon tequila
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 2 teaspoons minced tomato
- 1 ½ teaspoons chopped green chile peppers
- 1 teaspoon minced onion
- ¼ teaspoon dried parsley
- ¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch dried dill weed
- 1 pinch paprika
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 pinch ground cumin
- 1 pinch chili powder
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar/Monterey Jack cheese blend
- 2 cups crumbled corn chips

## Instructions

1. Combine water, teriyaki sauce, lime juice, garlic, liquid smoke, salt, ginger, and tequila in a medium nonporous glass bowl and mix all together. Add chicken and turn to coat; cover bowl and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.
2. Meanwhile, make the Mexi-Ranch Dressing: mix mayonnaise, sour cream, milk, tomato, peppers, onion, parsley, hot pepper sauce, salt, dill weed, paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, chili powder, and ground black pepper in a medium bowl and mix well until smooth. Cover bowl and chill until needed.
3. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler, or preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
4. Remove chicken from marinade, discarding any remaining marinade. Grill or broil chicken for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.
5. Arrange cooked chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread a layer of Mexi-Ranch dressing over each piece of chicken, followed by 1/4 cup of cheese blend. Broil in preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or just until cheese has melted.
6. Spread a bed of about 1/2 cup crumbled corn chips or tortilla strips on each of 4 plates. Slide a chicken breast onto the chips on each plate and serve.
