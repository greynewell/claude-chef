## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pound bulk Italian sausage
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 ½ cups chicken broth
- ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 bunch broccoli rabe, trimmed
- ¼ cup butter
- 1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the farfalle pasta, and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the Italian sausage until crumbly and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and continue cooking until the sausage begins to brown, about 5 minutes more. Pour off the excess grease, then pour in the chicken broth and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil over high heat, then add the broccoli rabe, and cover. Cook until the broccoli rabe is tender, about 4 minutes.
3. When the broccoli rabe is done, stir in the butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper until the meat sauce has thickened. Toss with the farfalle and serve.
