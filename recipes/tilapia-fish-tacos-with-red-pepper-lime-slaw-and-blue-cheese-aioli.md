## Ingredients

- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 cup roasted red pepper oil, divided
- ⅓ cup blue cheese salad dressing
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- ½ (8 ounce) container sour cream
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- ½ (16 ounce) package coleslaw mix
- 1  lime, juiced
- ½ medium white onion, diced
- 1  roasted red pepper, chopped
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed
- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
- 4 (3 ounce) fillets tilapia, cut into cubes
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 tablespoon sour cream
- 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning
- ½ teaspoon chopped fresh dill
- 1 (12 ounce) package soft corn tortillas

## Instructions

1. Whisk juice of 1 lime, 2 tablespoons red pepper oil, blue cheese dressing, mayonnaise, sour cream, 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon dill in a bowl until combined. Cover and place aioli sauce in freezer until ready to serve.
2. Place coleslaw mix in a medium bowl. Add juice of 1 lime, 1/2 cup red pepper oil, onion, and chopped roasted red pepper. Toss together until slaw is thoroughly mixed.
3. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic; cook until slightly browned, about 1 minute. Add tilapia; saute until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add juice of 1 lime, sour cream, cayenne pepper, Cajun seasoning, and dill. Cook and stir until tilapia is browned, about 4 minutes more. Reduce heat to low.
4. Heat the remaining vegetable oil in a smaller skillet over medium heat. Add tortillas 1 at a time. Cook until bubbles form and tortillas are lightly browned, about 1 minute per side.
