## Ingredients

- olive oil cooking spray
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons green hot pepper sauce
- 1 teaspoon chopped garlic
- 1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste
- ¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Place thawed spinach in a kitchen towel; wrap tightly to squeeze out excess water until spinach is just damp. Set aside.
3. Mix cream cheese, sour cream, onion powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Add artichoke hearts, drained spinach, hot sauce, and garlic; mix well. Add 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese; mix well. Pour into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle with extra cheese if you like a crispy, bubbly cheese layer on top.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and slightly browned on top, about 30 minutes.
