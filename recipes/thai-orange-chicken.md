## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3  carrots, cut into matchsticks
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small pieces
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup peanuts
- ⅓ cup orange juice
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, ginger, and garlic until carrots are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Transfer carrot mixture to a bowl. Add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the same skillet.
