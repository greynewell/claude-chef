## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon finely chopped red onion
- 1 teaspoon minced red bell pepper
- 1 tablespoon frozen green peas, thawed
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon grated carrot
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (5 ounce) can Bumble Bee® Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, drained and chunked
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice
- ¼ teaspoon sriracha chili garlic sauce
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 2 large fresh eggs
- 1  English muffin, split and toasted
- Chopped cilantro
- 1 teaspoon Black sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Place the red onion, red bell pepper, peas, ginger, carrots, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.
2. Stir together, and then fold in the tuna.
3. In a small bowl, whisk the sesame oil, rice vinegar, lime juice, and Sriracha®.
4. Pour over the tuna mixture and toss gently, trying not to break up the tuna.
5. Add a tablespoon of vinegar to a pan of lightly-salted water and bring it to a gentle simmer, not a hard boil (you'll see little bubbles in the pan).
6. Crack each egg into a ramekin.
7. Stir the water in a wide circle (like a whirlpool), and then slide in the egg; repeat for the second egg.
8. Poach the eggs at a simmer for 4-5 minutes for soft yolks.
9. Remove the poached eggs with a slotted spoon to a paper towel and allow to drain.
10. To serve, top half of an English muffin with half of the tuna mixture, place a poached egg on top, and then sprinkle with the chopped cilantro and black sesame seeds.
