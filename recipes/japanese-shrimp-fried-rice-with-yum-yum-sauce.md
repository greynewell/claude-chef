## Ingredients

- 2 cups uncooked jasmine rice
- 3 cups water
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1  sweet onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
- 1 (16 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots
- 4 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2  eggs
- 4 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1  lemon, juiced, divided
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ginger paste
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring 3 cups water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside and let cool.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Mix in cooked jasmine rice and frozen peas-carrot mixture; fry until rice begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons butter and stir to combine. Pour in eggs and cook until firm. Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, and 1/2 lemon juice; stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and fry until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and lemon juice. Combine with fried rice mixture.
4. Combine mayonnaise, water, paprika, ginger paste, white sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl to make the yum yum sauce. Stir well. Serve with the fried rice.
