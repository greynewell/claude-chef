## Ingredients

- 3 (8 ounce) packages tempeh, cut into 2-inch strips
- 2 (12 fluid ounce) bottles Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's® RedHot)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup crumbled blue cheese, or more to taste
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 large green bell pepper, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced, or more to taste
- ¼  red onion, diced
- 1 (5.3 ounce) container Greek yogurt, or as needed
- 18  pita pockets, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Place tempeh in a large bowl and cover with Buffalo sauce. Set aside to marinate, 10 to 20 minutes.
2. Remove tempeh from Buffalo sauce, reserving sauce. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tempeh in a single layer, in batches, until heated through and lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Pour some Buffalo sauce back over tempeh to coat.
3. Combine blue cheese, cilantro, green bell pepper, celery, and onion in a large bowl. Mix in enough Greek yogurt until topping just holds together.
4. Divide tempeh pieces among pita pockets; top with a spoonful of the topping. Top with remaining Buffalo sauce.
