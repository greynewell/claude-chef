## Ingredients

- 1  serving nonstick cooking spray
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 cup diced bell pepper
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
- 1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles (such as Ortega®)
- 2 tablespoons oil
- 1 tablespoon taco seasoning
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1 (8 ounce) package Neufchatel cheese, softened

## Instructions

1. Spray a slow cooker with cooking spray. Add onions, bell pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in chicken broth, diced tomatoes, condensed soup, and chiles.
2. Combine oil, taco seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, and black pepper in a bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat on all sides. Transfer to the slow cooker.
3. Cook on Low until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the slow cooker and shred.
4. Add Neufchatel cheese to the slow cooker and stir until melted. Return chicken to the slow cooker and cook until warmed through, 20 to 30 minutes more.
