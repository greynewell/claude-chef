## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground lamb
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ cup chopped red onion
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ½  green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tablespoon freshly ground cumin seed
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 pinch fenugreek seeds, finely crushed  (Optional)
- 1  lemon wedge
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 6 (6 inch) pita bread rounds
- ⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese  (Optional)
- 1  lime, cut into wedges
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Season lamb with salt and pepper, and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and bell pepper and stir until just beginning to brown. Stir in the cumin, turmeric, paprika, and fenugreek.
3. Immediately add the ground lamb. Squeeze lemon wedge over lamb, and drop the peel into the mixture. Break up the meat and stir until it has browned. Remove lemon peel.
4. Stir in the tomatoes, ketchup, and parsley. Continue to simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. The mixture should be spreadable but not too wet or the pitas will become soggy.
5. Arrange pitas on a large baking sheet unless you are baking them directly on the oven rack. Spoon meat mixture onto pitas and smooth into an even layer to within 1/8 inch of the edge of the pita. Sprinkle feta cheese on the meat mixture.
6. Bake pitas until the edges are slightly crisp and meat is lightly browned but not dried out, about 10 to 20 minutes depending on whether pitas are on a baking sheet or on the oven rack. Squeeze lime lightly over the top, sprinkle with chopped mint and enjoy!
