## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 ¼ pounds ground turkey
- 1 cup finely chopped white onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 ½ tablespoons prepared yellow mustard, divided
- ⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon chili powder
- 1 cup water
- ¼ cup finely chopped jalapeno
- 5  hamburger buns

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat; cook and stir the ground turkey, using the back of a wooden spoon to work the meat into small crumbles as it cooks. When the meat is about half browned, stir in the onion, garlic, and black pepper; cook and stir until the turkey is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink.
2. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the prepared mustard, the cayenne pepper, chili powder, and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring, until the water has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Stir in the remaining mustard and the chopped jalapeno, and cook until heated through, about 5 more minutes. Spoon the mixture onto the hamburger buns.
