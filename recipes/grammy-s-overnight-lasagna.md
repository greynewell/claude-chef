## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 (30 ounce) jar marinara sauce
- ¾ cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 12  lasagna noodles
- 1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese
- 12 ounces grated mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook the ground beef in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes; drain fat. Stir in the marinara sauce, water, and salt. Bring to a boil. Remove sauce from heat.
2. Arrange 6 noodles in a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking if necessary to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the sauce over noodles. Top with 1/2 of the cottage cheese and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sauce, cottage cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Top with Parmesan cheese. Cover tightly with foil; refrigerate overnight.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Bake lasagna, covered, until noodles are soft, cheese is melted, and sauce is bubbly, about 1 hour. Allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving.
