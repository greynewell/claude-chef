## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
- 1 pound bulk Italian sausage
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 4 cups spaghetti sauce
- 2 cups cottage cheese
- 2 cups mozzarella cheese, divided
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley
- ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking dish.
3. Cook sausage and onion in a large skillet until meat is no longer pink and onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Combine spaghetti sauce, cottage cheese, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, Italian seasoning, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add sausage and onion mixture; stir until well combined. Add pasta and carefully mix until well incorporated. Transfer to the prepared baking dish and cover.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, top with remaining mozzarella, and bake, uncovered, until cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.
