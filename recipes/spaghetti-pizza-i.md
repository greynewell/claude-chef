## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti, broken into 2-inch pieces
- 1  egg, beaten
- ¼ cup milk
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- 4 ounces pepperoni sausage, sliced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water.
3. Combine egg, milk, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese, salt, and garlic salt in a large bowl. Stir in cooked spaghetti; mix well.
4. Spread mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
