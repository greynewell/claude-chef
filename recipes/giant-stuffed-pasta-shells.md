## Ingredients

- 24  lumaconi pasta shells
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach
- 2 teaspoons ground thyme
- salt and ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 cups ricotta cheese
- ¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (28 ounce) jar pasta sauce
- ¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta shells in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms and garlic in hot oil until mushrooms are soft, about 7 minutes. Stir spinach and thyme into the mushroom mixture; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir the mixture until the spinach wilts. Remove the skillet from heat and drain any excess liquid; transfer drained mixture to a large bowl.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4. Mix ricotta cheese, 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese with the spinach mixture; season again with salt and pepper and stuff into pasta shells.
5. Arrange stuffed shells into a 9x11-inch baking dish. Pour pasta sauce over the shells; top with 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
6. Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the shells are hot, about 30 minutes.
