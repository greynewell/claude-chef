## Ingredients

- ¼ cup rice wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- ½ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger root
- 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 3 tablespoons white sugar
- 3  green onions, cut into 2 inch pieces
- ½  yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch thick rings
- 1 (2 pound) pork loin, cut into 1/4 inch slices

Mix in the pork slices, mixing well until completely coated. Place into a resealable plastic bag, squeeze out any excess air, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 3 hours.
