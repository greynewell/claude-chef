## Ingredients

- 1 (6 ounce) salmon fillet
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- ½ teaspoon refrigerated ginger paste
- 1 cup sugar snap peas
- ¼ cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place a sheet of aluminum foil on a flat work area.
2. Set salmon filet in the middle of the foil. Whisk honey, garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sriracha sauce, sesame oil, and ginger paste together in a small bowl. Pour mixture over salmon.
3. Mix together snap peas, mushrooms, and sweet chili sauce in a separate bowl. Scatter the veggies around the salmon. Fold foil over to create a sealed packet.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes. Carefully unseal the packet to expose the salmon, and broil on low until glaze is browned, about 5 minutes.
