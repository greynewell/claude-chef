## Ingredients

- ¾ cup apple cider
- ½ cup maple syrup
- ½ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt
- ½ cup unsweetened applesauce
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon maple extract
- 1 ⅓ cups whole wheat flour
- 1 cup rolled oats
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 cup peeled and diced apples
- ½ cup chopped walnuts, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
2. Whisk apple cider, maple syrup, yogurt, applesauce, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and maple extract together in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Mix in flour, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, salt, and nutmeg until incorporated. Fold in apples and walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan and tap the pan on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Allow bread to cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Gently run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen and turn loaf out onto a wire rack to cool.
