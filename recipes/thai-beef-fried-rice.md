## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 drops sesame oil, or to taste
- ½ cup diced red bell pepper
- ¼ cup diced onion
- 1  finely chopped green onion (white and light green parts)
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ pound cooked and crumbled ground beef
- ⅓ cup diced fresh tomato
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 cups cooked jasmine rice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 wedges lime  (Optional)
- 1  egg, beaten

## Instructions

1. Warm vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet. Add bell pepper, onion, and green onion; cook for 2 minutes. Add ground beef, sprinkle garlic powder over mixture, and cook for 1 minute longer.
2. Stir in diced tomato, fish sauce, and soy sauce; saute for 2 minutes. Add rice, mix until combined, and cook until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and squeeze lime wedged over top.
3. Pour beaten egg into a separate, small pan and let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that any uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 4 minutes.
4. Divide rice into two portions and serve 1/2 of the omelet over each serving.
