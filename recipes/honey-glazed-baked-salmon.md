## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup honey
- ⅓ cup thinly sliced green onions
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon minced onion
- ¾ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- 4  salmon fillets

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Mix honey, green onions, soy sauce, sesame seeds, garlic, onion, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl until blended.
3. Place salmon in single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon honey mixture evenly on top of salmon; the mixture will run off, but try to coat the fish with a thin layer all over.
4. Roast salmon in the preheated oven, basting salmon with the sauce at least once, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
