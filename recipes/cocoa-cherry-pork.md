## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon ground ancho chile pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper
- 2 (1 1/4 pound) boneless pork tenderloins
- kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- ⅓ cup cherry preserves
- ⅓ cup white vinegar
- 1 pinch dried oregano

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Whisk cocoa powder, ancho chile powder, cumin, black pepper, and chipotle pepper in a bowl.
