## Ingredients

- 1  eggplant, cut into 3/4-inch slices
- salt as needed
- 9 ounces pappardelle pasta (wide fettuccine noodles)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1  onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 (18 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ pound fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese, torn into pieces
- ½ cup chopped fresh basil, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Arrange eggplant slices in a colander and sprinkle with enough salt to lightly coat; drain for about 10 minutes. Rinse eggplant and pat dry with paper towels. Chop eggplant into cubes.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pappardelle at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 11 minutes; drain.
3. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir eggplant, adding more oil if eggplant gets dry, until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer eggplant to a bowl, reserving oil in the skillet.
4. Heat remaining oil in the same skillet; cook and stir onion and garlic until golden, about 10 minutes. Return eggplant to skillet and season with oregano; cook and stir for 1 minute more.
5. Mix tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar, and black pepper into eggplant mixture; cover skillet and simmer sauce until eggplant is softened, about 10 minutes. Mix sauce with pasta in a bowl; top with mozzarella cheese and basil.
