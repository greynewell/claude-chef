## Ingredients

- ½ pound baby spinach leaves
- 3 tablespoons white sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon mirin
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons white miso paste
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 2 (5 ounce) sushi-grade ahi tuna steaks
- salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon prepared ponzu sauce

## Instructions

1. Place spinach in a dry pot set over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until it just begins to wilt, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer into a strainer to cool.
2. While spinach cools, toast white sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat until light golden brown. Transfer into a mortar and pestle and crush into a very coarse paste, leaving some seeds whole. Add white sugar, soy sauce, and mirin. Stir with a wooden spoon to combine and reserve.
3. Transfer cooled spinach to a towel and squeeze out any excess liquid. Chop roughly and add to a mixing bowl. Add the dressing and mix well. Cover and chill thoroughly before serving.
4. Mix mayonnaise, miso paste, and rice vinegar together for miso mayo sauce. Place in the refrigerator until needed.
5. Lightly salt tuna steaks, and then coat all sides well with as many sesame seeds as you like, pressing them lightly as you do.
6. Brush a nonstick pan with oil and place over medium heat. Sear tuna steaks in the hot pan for 30 to 45 seconds on each side, as well as each edges.
7. Slice and place tuna over the miso sauce. Brush tuna with ponzu and serve with spinach salad on the side.
