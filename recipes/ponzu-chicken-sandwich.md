## Ingredients

- 1 cup prepared ponzu sauce
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- ½ cup pineapple juice
- 4  fresh mint leaves, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon chili oil
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into chunks
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, sliced
- 1  red bell pepper, sliced
- 1  jalapeno pepper, sliced
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 small head cabbage, shredded
- 4  Italian-style hoagie buns, split lengthwise and toasted
- 12 slices Swiss cheese
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, divided
- 1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®), or to taste - divided
- 1  lime, cut into wedges

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
2. Combine ponzu sauce, 1 cup cilantro, pineapple juice, mint leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, sesame oil, chili oil, and brown sugar together in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat.
3. Remove chicken from ponzu sauce mixture, reserving marinade. Heat large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in olive oil, onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Pour reserved marinade into chicken mixture and bring to a boil. Stir in cabbage and cook until slightly wilted, 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken mixture into toasted hoagie buns and top each sandwich with 3 slices Swiss cheese.
6. Place sandwiches onto a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and buns are toasted, about 5 minutes. Garnish each sandwich with 2 tablespoons cilantro, 1/4 of the sesame seeds, and 1/4 of the chile-garlic sauce. Serve with lime wedges.
