## Ingredients

- 12  Yukon Gold potatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
- 1  onion, sliced
- 6  chile peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
- 1 pound cream cheese, softened
- 1 pound queso fresco (Mexican fresh cheese), crumbled
- ¼ cup vegetable oil
- 1 clove garlic
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅓ cup evaporated milk
- 4  hard-boiled eggs, halved lengthwise
- 8 leaves lettuce
- 8  black olives, pitted and halved

## Instructions

1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.
2. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion until tender, about 10 minutes.
3. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Boil chile peppers until soft, about 5 minutes. Run chiles under cold water to cool until cool enough to handle; remove and discard skins.
4. Blend onion, chile peppers, cheese, vegetable oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a blender until smooth. Stream evaporated milk into the blended mixture while continuing to blend until a creamy sauce is achieved.
5. Arrange 1 lettuce leaf onto each of 8 plates. Halve potatoes and arrange 3 halves onto each lettuce leaf. Drizzle creamy sauce over the potatoes. Top each with an egg half and two black olive halves.
