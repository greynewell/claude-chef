## Ingredients

- 1  lemon, thinly sliced
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- ¾ teaspoon dried thyme, divided
- 2  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- ¾ teaspoon paprika
- ⅓ cup light mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 ½ cups fresh corn, cooked and cut from the cob
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- ¾ cup diced orange bell pepper
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced

## Instructions

1. Fill a large skillet with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Add lemon slices, bay leaf, peppercorns and 2/3 of the thyme, and bring to boiling over high heat. Add chicken, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-18 minutes, turning chicken once, until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink. Remove chicken from liquid and set aside to cool.
2. In a small skillet, stir together the paprika and remaining thyme over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the toasted paprika mixture, mayonnaise, sour cream, salt, ground pepper and nutmeg until evenly blended.
3. Cube cooled chicken and transfer to a medium bowl. Add prepared dressing, corn, cilantro, orange pepper and jalapeno and toss until evenly coated. Serve warm, or refrigerate until ready to serve.
