## Ingredients

- 1 quart chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½  onion, minced
- 1 ¼ cups Arborio rice
- ½ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons white truffle oil
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon milk, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Heat chicken broth in a stockpot over medium-low heat until warmed.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan; cook and stir onion in the melted butter-oil mixture until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add rice to onion mixture and stir to coat; cook and stir rice mixture until fragrant, about 1 minute.
