## Ingredients

- 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
- 2 cups warm water (110 degrees F (43 degrees C))
- 6 cups bread flour
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 4 tablespoons za'atar
- 4 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Mix in 3 cups flour and salt. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth, about 10 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl; turn to coat with oil. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
4. Divide dough into 16 equal pieces and form into rounds. Roll into 1/4-inch-thick circles. Poke rounds with your fingers to create small indentations.
5. Mix za'atar and olive oil together in a small bowl. Spread over circles. Place on ungreased baking sheets.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
