## Ingredients

- ½ cup honey
- ½ cup hoisin sauce
- ½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- cooking spray
- 5  boneless center-cut pork loin chops

## Instructions

1. Mix honey, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, ginger, chili-garlic sauce, garlic, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Place pork chops in a resealable plastic bag. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over pork chops; seal bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 8 hours to overnight. Place remaining marinade in an airtight container and refrigerate.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly spray the grate. Remove pork chops from the bag and shake off excess marinade; discard marinade from the bag. Grill pork chops, basting with refrigerated marinade, until browned and no longer pink inside, 8 to 10 minutes per side.
3. Pour remaining marinade into a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Spoon sauce over pork chops.
