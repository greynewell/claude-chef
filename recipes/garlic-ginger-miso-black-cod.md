## Ingredients

- 1 (2 inch) piece ginger, sliced, divided
- 6 cloves garlic, divided, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (soy-free seasoning sauce)
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar, or more to taste
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon miso
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
