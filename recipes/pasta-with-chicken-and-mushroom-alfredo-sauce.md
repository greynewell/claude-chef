## Ingredients

- cooking spray
- 2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti
- ½ cup salted butter
- 2 cups sliced mushrooms
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 2 cups heavy cream
- salt and ground white pepper to taste
- ¾ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray, place chicken breasts in the pan, and cover with a lid or foil.
2. Bake in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and shred with 2 forks.
3. While the chicken is roasting, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
4. Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add cream cheese; stir until melted. Whisk in heavy cream and season with salt and pepper.
5. Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all combined and creamy, about 3 minutes. Don't simmer for to long or over high heat; the sauce can break down and become curdled instead of creamy.
6. Drain pasta and add to sauce with shredded chicken.
