## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups gluten-free bread crumbs (such as Hodgson Mill®)
- 1  eggplant, peeled into long strips 1/4-inch thick
- 2  eggs, beaten
- ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, divided
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 pinch dried basil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour bread crumbs in a shallow bowl.
2. Dip eggplant into eggs; coat with gluten-free bread crumbs. Place in a single layer on prepared baking sheet; lightly sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 6 minutes; remove from oven. Flip eggplant with a spatula; brush with olive oil. Bake until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Remove from oven; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
