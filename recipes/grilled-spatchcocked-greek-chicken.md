## Ingredients

- 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
- 1 teaspoon dried tarragon
- 1 (4.5 pound) whole chicken, spatchcocked
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, garlic, rosemary, and tarragon together in a measuring cup.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1/2 of the oil mixture over the chicken and reserve the remaining 1/2. Using your hands, massage the oil mixture into the chicken skin. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Grill chicken skin-side up over indirect heat for 50 minutes. Move chicken over direct heat and grill 5 minutes. Carefully flip chicken over skin-side down and grill until skin is brown and crispy, about 5 more minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes.
5. Drizzle reserved oil mixture over the chicken. Carve and serve.
