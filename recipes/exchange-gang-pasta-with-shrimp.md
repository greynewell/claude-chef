## Ingredients

- ½ pound spaghetti
- 4 tablespoons butter, divided
- 2  shallots, minced
- 1 cup diced mushrooms
- 1 cup grape tomatoes, quartered
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ¼ cup white wine
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 cups torn fresh spinach leaves
- ½ cup half-and-half cream
- ¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
2. Stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil.
3. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
4. Drain; toss with 2 tablespoons of the butter.
5. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the shallots and mushrooms until the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.
6. Stir in the grape tomatoes and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook and stir until tomatoes are heated through, about 3 minutes.
7. Add the shrimp, and cook until the shrimp just begins to turn pink, stirring occasionally.
8. Stir in the white wine and lemon juice, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer until shrimp are opaque, about 5 minutes.
9. Stir in the spinach; once spinach has wilted, stir in the half-and-half and Parmesan cheese.
10. Simmer until all ingredients are heated through and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
11. Serve over the cooked spaghetti.
