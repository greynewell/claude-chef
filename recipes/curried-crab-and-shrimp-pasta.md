## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package fusilli pasta
- ½ cup salted butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons curry powder, or to taste
- ¾ pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
- ½ pound fresh crabmeat, well drained
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well and transfer to a serving bowl and keep warm.
2. While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and 1/2 cup parsley; cook until onion is tender and has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Stir in curry powder. Add shrimp and crabmeat. Cook and stir for 4 minutes. Stir in cream, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil and cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour sauce over pasta and toss to coat. Garnish with remaining parsley.
