## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano, or more to taste
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on all sides and place in a bowl or lidded container. Combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and thyme in a small bowl and pour marinade over chicken breasts. Marinate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Set one oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
