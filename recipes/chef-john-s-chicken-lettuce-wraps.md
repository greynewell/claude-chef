## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
- 1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and minced
- 1 cup diced shiitake mushroom caps
- ½ cup minced yellow onion
- ⅓ cup chopped green onion
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- ¼ cup chicken stock
- ¼ cup rice wine vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ketchup
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- ½ teaspoon dry mustard
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh basil, or to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons chopped green onion, or to taste
- 16 leaves iceberg lettuce, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Stir chicken, water chestnuts, mushrooms, yellow onion, 1/3 cup green onion, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, ginger, and 2 teaspoons brown sugar together in a bowl. Pat mixture down, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use.
2. Whisk chicken stock, rice wine vinegar, garlic, ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 teaspoons brown sugar, red pepper flakes, and dry mustard together in a bowl until glaze is well-mixed.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy nonstick skillet over high heat. Cook and stir chicken mixture in hot oil until chicken no longer looks raw, about 2 minutes. Pour 1/2 of the glaze mixture into chicken mixture; cook and stir over high heat until chicken begins to caramelize and brown, 10 to 15 minutes.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low, pour remaining glaze into chicken mixture, and cook until heated through and slightly reduced, about 3 minutes more. Stir in cilantro, basil, and 1 1/2 tablespoons green onion. Transfer chicken mixture to a bowl and serve with lettuce leaves to wrap.
