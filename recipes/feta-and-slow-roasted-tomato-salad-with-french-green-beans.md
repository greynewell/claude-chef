## Ingredients

- 12  cherry tomatoes
- salt and black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1  bay leaf, crumbled
- ¼ cup pine nuts
- ⅔ pound thin green beans, trimmed
- 1 (5 ounce) package arugula leaves
- 6  fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon honey
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 6 ounces crumbled feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat an oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).
2. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, and arrange them, cut sides up, on a baking sheet. Sprinkle them with salt, pepper, and the bay leaf; drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil.
3. Bake the tomatoes until they are shriveled and dry on the outside, but a little moist inside, about 2 hours.
4. Toast the pine nuts in a small pan over medium-low heat, gently shaking the pan as they toast, until beginning brown and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes; set aside.
5. Bring a saucepan of water to a boil; cook the green beans in the boiling water until bright green but still crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse immediately with cold water.
6. Combine the roasted tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, green beans, arugula, and basil in a salad bowl. Whisk together the red wine vinegar, mustard, garlic, honey, and 1/4 cup olive oil in a bowl, and pour the dressing over the salad. Stir in the crumbled feta cheese just before serving.
