## Ingredients

- 3 cups medium-grain white rice, uncooked
- 3 cups water
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- 6 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 2 cups imitation crabmeat
- 2 cups thinly sliced cucumber
- 1 medium avocado, thinly sliced
- 1 (8 ounce) package cold cream cheese, cut into thin strips
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds, or to taste
- 1 ½ cups soy sauce
- 1 medium lime, juiced
- 2 medium oranges, juiced

## Instructions

1. Rinse rice under cool water until water is no longer cloudy and runs clear. Combine rice and water in a covered saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, mix vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and let cool.
3. Combine softened cream cheese and mayonnaise in a blender; process until creamy.
4. Transfer cooked rice to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the vinegar sauce over the hot rice; mix gently. Taste and add more vinegar sauce if desired. Empty 1/2 of the cooked rice into a springform pan; press down gently to fill the bottom of the pan.
5. Spread 1/2 of the cream cheese-mayonnaise mixture on top of the rice in the pan. Layer crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, and cold cream cheese over top, in that order. Spread the remaining cream cheese-mayonnaise mixture over top. Empty the remaining rice into the pan and press downwards until layers are firmly packed. Garnish with sesame seeds. Place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
6. To serve, mix soy sauce, orange juice, and lime juice in a bowl. Dismount the sushi cake from the springform pan and serve it with the soy sauce.
