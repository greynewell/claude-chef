## Ingredients

- 8  boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- ¼ cup avocado oil
- 1  lime, juiced
- 3 tablespoons agave syrup
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  mangoes, peeled and diced
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- ½  red bell pepper, diced
- 1  lime, juiced
- 1 pinch salt, or to taste
- 1 pinch cayenne, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place chicken thighs in a gallon-sized resealable bag.
2. Combine avocado oil, lime juice, agave syrup, garlic, chili powder, cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper in a bowl; stir together to create the marinade. Pour marinade into the bag with the chicken. Squeeze out as much air as possible, seal, and place in the refrigerator, making sure chicken pieces are in a single layer. Marinate for 8 hours, turning chicken pieces occasionally.
3. Prepare salsa about 1 hour before cooking time. Combine mangoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, bell pepper, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a bowl. Mix to combine and refrigerate for 1 hour.
4. Set an oven rack about 5 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
5. Place chicken thighs in a single layer on a broiler pan and discard marinade. Broil for 5 minutes. Flip and broil until chicken is slightly caramelized and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve chicken warm, with salsa.
