## Ingredients

- 1 ear corn, shucked
- 1  avocado, diced
- ⅓ cup diced fresh tomato
- ¼ cup black beans, rinsed and drained
- ¼ cup diced red onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon minced jalapeno pepper  (Optional)
- 2 wedges lime, divided, or more to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2  tilapia fillets
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 tablespoon salted butter
- 1 teaspoon chicken broth, or as needed
- ¼ cup heavy cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
2. Place corn on the preheated grill and cook, turning often, until charred all over, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate and remove kernels when cool enough to handle.
3. Combine corn kernels, avocado, tomato, black beans, red onion, cilantro, and jalapeno in a large bowl. Squeeze 1 lime wedge over top and season with salt and pepper. Store in the refrigerator until cold, about 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, season tilapia on both sides with Cajun seasoning.
5. Melt butter in a medium stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat; cook until just before butter begins to brown. Add tilapia and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 1 more minute. Tilt the skillet and baste with the butter until fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, about 5 more minutes. Remove fish from the skillet.
6. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Whisk in cream. Squeeze in another lime wedge, then taste and adjust for your desired level of tanginess. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat.
7. Serve fish with cold salsa, adding cream sauce to both, if desired.
