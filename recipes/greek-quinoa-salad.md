## Ingredients

- ½ cup pine nuts
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups chopped fresh spinach
- 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup halved grape tomatoes
- ½ cup halved Kalamata olives
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- ¼ cup minced red onion
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir pine nuts in the hot skillet until fragrant and toasted, about 5 minutes.
2. Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes; fluff with a fork and cool to room temperature.
