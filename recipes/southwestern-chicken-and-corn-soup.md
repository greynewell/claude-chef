## Ingredients

- 10 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup diced yellow onion
- 1 cup diced red bell pepper
- 1 large jalapeno chile pepper, diced
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 5 cups Swanson® Unsalted Chicken Broth
- 3 ½ cups Yukon gold potatoes, 3/4-inch dice
- 1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
- 3 cups frozen corn
- 3 cups chopped rotisserie chicken
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 1 cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
- ½ cup grated sharp Cheddar cheese
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- ¼ cup chopped green onion

## Instructions

1. Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and slightly crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons bacon grease from pot.
2. Melt butter in the pot with the remaining bacon grease over medium heat. Add onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeno. Sautee until just softened, 5 or 6 minutes. Add minced garlic and saute for 1 minute. Whisk in flour and stir until completely incorporated, about 2 minutes.
3. Season with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Gradually whisk in Swanson® Unsalted Chicken Broth, stirring to prevent flour from clumping. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and green chilies; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until vegetables begin to soften, about 12 minutes
4. Stir in frozen corn and chopped chicken. Add 1/2 cup of cooked bacon pieces. Add half and half; stir. Reduce heat to low; simmer very slowly until chicken and corn are heated through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat. Stir in 1 cup grated Cheddar cheese until cheese melts.
5. Pour soup into bowls and garnish with reserved bacon, grated Cheddar cheese, cilantro, and green onions.
