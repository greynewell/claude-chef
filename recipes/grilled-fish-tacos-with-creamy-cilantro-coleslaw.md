## Ingredients

- 1 small head green cabbage
- ⅔ cup sour cream
- ½  red onion, sliced
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Quarter and thinly slice the cabbage; put in a large bowl. Mix sour cream, onion, cilantro, lime juice, cumin, garlic, and salt in a separate bowl. Pour sour cream mixture over the cabbage and toss to combine. Cover and set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
