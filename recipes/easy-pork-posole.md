## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork loin, chopped
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1  onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons water
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  serrano peppers, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes

- 2 (15 ounce) cans hominy, drained
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Season pork with salt and pepper.
