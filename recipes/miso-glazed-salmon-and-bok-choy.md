## Ingredients

- ½ cup miso
- ⅓ cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
- ¼ cup sake (Japanese rice wine)
- 3 tablespoons firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 ½ pounds salmon fillets
- 2 heads   baby bok choy, halved lengthwise, or more to taste

## Instructions

1. Stir miso, mirin, sake, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a shallow dish. Add salmon fillets; turn to coat. Marinate at room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
2. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
3. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Transfer fillets onto the baking sheet, reserving marinade.
4. Place bok choy in the marinade; turn to coat. Arrange bok choy next to salmon on the baking sheet, reserving marinade.
5. Broil in the preheated oven until salmon is lightly charred on the edges, about 4 minutes. Flip salmon and bok choy; brush with reserved marinade. Continue cooking until salmon is browned and flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes. Transfer salmon to serving plates. Continue cooking bok choy until it is tender-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes more.
