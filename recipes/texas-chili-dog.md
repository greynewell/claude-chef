## Ingredients

- 8  Ball Park® Brand Franks
- 8  Ball Park® Hot Dog Buns
- Yellow mustard
- 1 cup chopped yellow onion
- 2 cups grated Cheddar cheese
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and thinly sliced

## Instructions

1. Brown ground beef in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large saucepan for about 10 minutes over medium heat. Add onion and red bell pepper, stirring well.

2. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
3. Cook hot dogs on your grill or on a grill pan until just seared on the outside.
