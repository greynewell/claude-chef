## Ingredients

- 5  poblano peppers
- 2 cups chicken bone broth
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

- ½ cup salsa verde
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ¼ cup chopped onion

## Instructions

1. Roast poblano peppers over open flame on a gas stove or grill until all sides are charred, 5 to 8 minutes. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins.

3. Peel the cooled poblano peppers and remove seeds. Finely chop peppers in a food processor.
4. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and cumin. Cook and stir until slightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add poblanos and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken and saute for 2 minutes more.
5. Pour cheese mixture into a stockpot over low heat. Add the chicken mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook until heated through, at least 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
