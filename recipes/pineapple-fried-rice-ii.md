## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked white rice
- 2 cups water
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 3  green onions, thinly sliced including tops
- 1 cup diced ham
- ½ cup peas
- 1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon white pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ cup soy sauce

## Instructions

1. Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Spread cooked rice out on a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate until cooled, about 20 minutes.
2. Heat sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the green onions, ham, and peas in the hot oil until onions have softened, about 2 minutes. Stir the pineapple chunks into the wok; cook until pineapple begins to darken, about 2 minute. Push ingredients to the side of the wok, and pour beaten egg in the center. Cook until egg begins to set, about 30 seconds. Stir together all contents of the wok.
3. Mix the cooled rice, sugar, salt, white pepper, and garlic powder into the wok; stir constantly to keep from sticking. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the rice with the soy sauce, and stir to combine.
