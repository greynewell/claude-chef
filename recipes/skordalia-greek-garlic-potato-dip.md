## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ pounds russet potatoes
- 6 cloves garlic, sliced, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste
- ½  lemon, juiced
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 drizzle olive oil, or to taste
- 1 pinch minced fresh oregano

## Instructions

1. Peel and quarter the potatoes and add to a saucepan with enough cold salted water to cover by 1 inch. Place over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and continue to simmer until potatoes are tender, but not falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.
2. While potatoes are cooking, add garlic and 1 teaspoon kosher salt to a mortar and pestle. Crush into a fine paste and reserve.
3. Drain potatoes, reserving some of the cooking water to thin the dip out with later if desired. Let sit for 5 minutes.
4. Transfer the potatoes to a mixing bowl. Mash with a potato masher or potato ricer until smooth and lump free. Stir in garlic paste. Add lemon juice and vinegar and stir in with the masher.
5. Whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil in 3 or 4 additions. Add cayenne and more salt if needed. Pass dip through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Serve at room temperature, garnished with olive oil and oregano.
