## Ingredients

- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 large green bell pepper, chopped
- 2  celery stalks, chopped
- 1 pound andouille or smoked sausage, sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- salt and pepper to taste
- Creole seasoning to taste
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1  bay leaf
- 1  rotisserie chicken, boned and shredded

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a stockpot over medium heat; whisk in flour until roux is smooth and has cooked to the color of chocolate milk, about 8 to 10 minutes. Be careful not to burn the roux. If you see black specks in the mixture, it's best to start over.
2. Add sausage, celery, bell pepper, and onion into the roux; cook and stir 5 minutes. Add garlic; continue to cook and stir another 5 minutes.
3. Season with salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning; stir well to blend. Pour in chicken broth and add bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
4. Stir in the chicken and simmer 1 hour more. Skim off any foam that floats to the top during this time.
