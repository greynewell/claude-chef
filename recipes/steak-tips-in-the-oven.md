## Ingredients

- ¾ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown mustard
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 whole cloves
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup beef broth, or as needed
- 2 pounds sirloin steak tips

## Instructions

1. Whisk soy sauce, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, molasses, sesame oil, cinnamon, cloves, salt, and pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add steak tips and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 24 hours.
2. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
3. Remove steak tips from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Put steak tips into a baking dish and fill the bottom of the dish with beef broth.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until steak tips are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 25 minutes, flipping halfway. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
