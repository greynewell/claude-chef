## Ingredients

- ¾ pound shredded cooked chicken
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as RO*TEL®), drained
- 1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles, drained
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 18 (6 inch) corn tortillas
- cooking spray (such as Pam®)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine chicken, beans, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, diced green chile peppers, cumin, chili powder, salt, and garlic in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until filling is heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add Mexican cheese blend to filling and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.
3. Place corn tortillas on a microwave-safe plate and cover with a wet paper towel; heat in microwave until tortillas are warmed, about 30 seconds.
4. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons filling down the middle of each tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around the filling and place, seam-side down, on a baking sheet. Spray the rolled tortillas with cooking spray.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crispy, about 30 minutes.
