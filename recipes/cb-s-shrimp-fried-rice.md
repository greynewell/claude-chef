## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons water
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 5 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 5 cups cold cooked rice
- 2 ½ cups small cooked, tail-off shrimp
- 5 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup finely chopped green onion
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Whisk eggs and water together in a small bowl.
2. Melt butter in a large nonstick frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add egg mixture and cook, without stirring, until almost firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 1 minute more. Carefully transfer egg to a plate and slice into thin strips, about 2 1/2-inches long.
3. Heat oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, until rice is nicely separated and firm, but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, soy sauce, sesame oil, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Add green onion and egg strips; cook for 1 minute.
4. Season with salt and additional soy sauce if needed.
