## Ingredients

- ½ (8 ounce) package pancit bihon (rice noodles)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chopped cooked chicken

## Instructions

1. Soak bihon in a bowl of warm water until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain.
2. Heat oil in a large wok over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until flavors combine, about 3 minutes. Add shrimp; cook until they start to turn color, about 1 minute. Add soy sauce; toss in cabbage, celery, and carrot.
