## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 pound hot Italian sausage
- 1 pound mild Italian sausage
- 2  sweet onions, chopped
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 (48 ounce) can beef broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes with basil
- ½ cup sweet wine  (Optional)
- 2 sprigs fresh basil, or to taste
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, or more to taste
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste
- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook hot and mild sausage, stirring to break up into pieces, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Stir tomato paste into the paste. Fill tomato paste can with water and pour in; mix well. Pour in beef broth, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, and wine. Stir in basil sprigs, salt, and pepper. Bring soup to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors combine, at least 30 minutes.
3. Mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
4. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.
5. Divide pasta among serving bowls; spoon some of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Ladle soup over cheese mixture.
