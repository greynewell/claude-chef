## Ingredients

- ½ cup lime juice
- ¼ cup orange juice
- ¼ cup grapefruit juice
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup vinegar
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 5 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
- ½ teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 pound fresh shrimp - peeled, deveined, and tails removed
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Pour lime, orange, grapefruit, and lemon juices into a blender or food processor. Add vinegar, oil, garlic, Mexican oregano, red pepper flakes, and cumin. Pulse several times, then blend until the garlic pieces disappear, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper and pulse one more time.
2. Pour marinade into a 1-gallon resealable bag and add shrimp. Squeeze most of the air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for 15 minutes, with the shrimp inside the bag in a single layer. Drain and reserve marinade.
3. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook shrimp in a single layer, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side. Shrimp are done when they are opaque, pink and white, and curled into a "C" shape. Remove shrimp from the skillet and set aside.
4. Pour reserved marinade into the same skillet and bring to a boil. Boil until marinade is reduced to about 2/3 cup, about 6 minutes. Pour into a small serving pitcher or sauce boat.
5. Serve shrimp with sauce on the side as a dipping sauce, or toss shrimp in the sauce. Garnish with fresh cilantro.
