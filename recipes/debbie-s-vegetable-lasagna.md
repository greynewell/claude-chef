## Ingredients

- 9  lasagna noodles
- ¼ cup margarine
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup vegetable broth, or as needed
- 2 tablespoons white wine
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 cup light ricotta cheese
- 1  egg
- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cups coarsely shredded carrots
- 2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
4. Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
5. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
6. Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
