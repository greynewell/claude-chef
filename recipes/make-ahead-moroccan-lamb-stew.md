## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- ⅛ teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1  sweet onion, chopped
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can organic beef broth
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can organic chicken broth
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef consomme
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 tablespoon honey

## Instructions

1. Combine cinnamon, cumin, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, turmeric, curry powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in the ground lamb. For most flavorful results, allow mixture to rest, refrigerated, overnight.
2. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the onion in the butter until soft and just beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix the spiced lamb mixture to the onions. Cook and stir until meat is browned, about 5 minutes.
3. Pour the beef broth, chicken broth, and consomme into the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, honey, carrots, sweet potatoes, garbanzo beans, dried apricots and lentils. Bring to boil; reduce heat to low.
4. Simmer stew for 30 minutes or until the vegetables and lentils are cooked and tender. Season with black pepper to taste.
