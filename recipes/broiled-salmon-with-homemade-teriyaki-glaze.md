## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups water, divided
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 ½ pounds salmon fillets
- 1 medium green onion, thinly sliced
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Combine 1/4 cup cold water and cornstarch in a small bowl with a lid. Seal and shake until cornstarch has dissolved. Set aside.
2. Combine remaining 1 cup water, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and garlic in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer until sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Measure out 1/2 cup of teriyaki glaze and set aside.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low. Place salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush on all sides with teriyaki glaze.
4. Broil salmon for 12 minutes. Turn broiler to high. Brush reserved glaze over the top. Broil on high until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 3 minutes. Serve garnished with green onion and sesame seeds.
