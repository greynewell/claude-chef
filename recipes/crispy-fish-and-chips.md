## Ingredients

- Nonstick cooking spray
- ½ cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt
- ¼ cup sliced green onions
- 2 teaspoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon black pepper, divided
- 3 cups shredded coleslaw mix
- 1 pound sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 4 (4 ounce) fillets fresh or frozen whitefish such as haddock or cod, 1 inch thick
- 1  egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon water
- 2 ½ cups puffed corn cereal or corn flakes, crushed

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 10x15-inch baking pan with foil and coat lightly with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Stir together yogurt, green onions, lime juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl. Stir in coleslaw. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.
3. Arrange sweet potatoes on prepared pan. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle with chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Bake in preheated oven until tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
4. Rinse fish and pat dry with a paper towel. Stir together egg and water in a shallow dish. Mix together cereal, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper in another shallow dish. Dip each fillet in egg mixture, letting excess drip off; dip in cereal mixture, turning to coat.
5. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add fish and cook until just golden, about 3 minutes. Turn fish. Transfer skillet to oven. Bake until fish flakes easily, about 15 minutes. Serve with sweet potatoes and slaw.
