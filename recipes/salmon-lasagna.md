## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups milk
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 2 (9 ounce) boxes frozen creamed spinach, thawed
- 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 (8 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles
- 1 (15 ounce) can salmon, drained and flaked
- aluminum foil

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk the milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese and pepper, remove from heat and set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
3. Mix spinach, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese together in a medium bowl.
4. Spread 1/4 cup of the white sauce over the bottom of a rectangular baking dish. Arrange 1/3 of the lasagna noodles overtop, overlapping to fit. Spoon 1/2 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles and top with 1/2 of the salmon. Repeat layers once more, then top with remaining noodles and remaining white sauce. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove and discard foil. Continue baking until bubbly, another 15 minutes.
