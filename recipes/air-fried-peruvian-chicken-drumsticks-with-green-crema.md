## Ingredients

- olive oil for brushing
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 6 (4 ounce) chicken drumsticks
- 1 cup baby spinach leaves, stems removed
- ¾ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup cilantro leaves
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 1 clove garlic, smashed
- ½  jalapeno pepper, seeded
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Brush an air fryer basket with olive oil.
2. Combine garlic, honey, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, cumin, paprika, oregano, and pepper in a large bowl. Add drumsticks; toss to coat. Arrange drumsticks vertically in the prepared basket, leaning against the basket wall and one another.
3. Cook in the air fryer at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the drumstick reads 175 degrees F (80 degrees C), 15 to 20 minutes. Rearrange drumsticks with kitchen tongs halfway through cooking for even cooking.
4. Meanwhile, combine spinach, sour cream, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, jalapeno pepper, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor; process until crema is smooth. Drizzle some crema sauce over drumsticks and serve with remaining crema.
