## Ingredients

- 3 pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground ancho chile powder
- 2 teaspoons ground chipotle chile pepper
- 2 tablespoons salt-free seasoning blend
- 1 ½ teaspoons liquid smoke flavoring
- ¾ cup Worcestershire sauce
- black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Place the beef cubes into a large mixing bowl. Season with brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, ancho powder, chipotle powder, salt-free seasoning, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.
