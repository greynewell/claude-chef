## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) package thin spaghetti
- 1 (8 ounce) package broccoli florets
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise (such as Kewpie®)
- 2 tablespoons chili crisp oil sauce
- 2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, minced
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- ½ pound small bay scallops
- 1  green onion, chopped

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. At the same time, combine broccoli with 2 to 3 tablespoons water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover tightly and cook on high until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain any liquid and set aside.
3. Mix soy sauce, mayonnaise, chili crisp, gochujang, sugar, garlic powder, and ginger together in a medium bowl.
4. Heat oil and butter in a wok over medium heat until butter is sizzling but before it turns brown. Add onion and saute for 1 minute. Add scallops; cook and stir until seared, about 3 minutes. Mix in steamed broccoli and saute for 1 to 2 minutes. Pour soy sauce mixture over top and quickly add drained spaghetti. Toss until thoroughly combined and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Sprinkle green onion over top and serve.
