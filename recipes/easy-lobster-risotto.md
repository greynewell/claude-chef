## Ingredients

- 1 ½ medium onions
- 1  carrot, roughly chopped
- 1  bay leaf
- 1 pound live lobsters
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 ½ cups Arborio rice
- 1 cup dry white wine
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup finely chopped Italian parsley
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Coarsely chop 1 onion. Finely chop remaining 1/2 onion.
2. Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot, and add coarsely chopped onion, carrot, and bay leaf. Prepare an ice bath. Plunge the lobsters into the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Remove and submerge in the ice bath for 1 minute, then drain and set aside. Keep the lobster cooking liquid warm over low heat.
3. Combine olive oil, finely chopped onion, and tomato paste in a deep, 10- to 12-inch skillet and cook over medium heat until onion is softened but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add rice and stir with a wooden spoon until toasted and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Add wine, then add a 4- to 6-ounce ladleful of the lobster cooking liquid and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed. Continue stirring and adding the liquid a ladleful at a time, waiting until the liquid is absorbed each time before adding more, for 15 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, remove the lobster meat from the shell, leaving the claws whole, and chop the tail meat into 1-inch pieces. Toss the lobster into the rice and continue cooking until the rice is tender and creamy but still al dente, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Remove from heat; add parsley and butter, and stir vigorously. Serve immediately.
