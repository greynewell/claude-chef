## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons corn oil
- 8 ounces chorizo sausage
- 8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese
- 1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Heat the corn oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Crumble in the chorizo sausage; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan, and set aside. Place slices of cheese in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. It is okay if they overlap a little bit. When cheese melts, quickly pour into a nice casserole dish, or oven-proof bowl. Sprinkle the chorizo on top.
3. Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheese is fully melted. Remove from the oven, stick a fork in it and load your tortilla.
