## Ingredients

- 4 cloves garlic, sliced
- 1 large pinch kosher salt, plus more to taste
- ½ cup chopped raw walnuts
- ½ cup chopped Italian parsley
- Juice from one lemon
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- water, if needed

## Instructions

1. Place garlic and salt in a mortar; smash and mash with the pestle until it becomes a paste, 5 to 8 minutes. Add walnuts; mash walnuts into a paste until you reach your desired texture (coarse or smoother), another 5 to 8 minutes. Add parsley and mash to break up and blend with the walnut/garlic mixture, about 4 minutes. Add lemon juice and olive oil; stir, mash, and emulsify liquids into the mixture until it becomes very thick and well blended, 8 to 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. If mixture seems too thick, whisk in a tablespoon of water, or as needed.
2. Spread on bread, use on pizza or pasta, or on roasted chicken. The taste is just like garlic butter, so use it as such.
