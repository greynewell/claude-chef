      "Brown sugar and beer create a rich glaze; the Guinness adds depth without overwhelming the beef",
      "Cook on low for tender, fall-apart meat; high heat will toughen the brisket",
      "The corning spice packet already on the brisket provides saltiness, so taste before adding extra salt"
