      "Thaw the peas thoroughly under cold running water and drain well to prevent excess moisture from making the salad watery",
      "Finely chop the almonds and onion into similar-sized pieces for even flavor distribution and better texture throughout the salad",
      "Start with 3/4 cup of mayonnaise and add more gradually while mixing to achieve your preferred creaminess rather than oversaturating the salad",
      "Refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours before serving to allow flavors to meld and for the salad to reach optimal serving temperature"
