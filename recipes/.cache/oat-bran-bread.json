      "Use water at exactly 110°F to activate the yeast properly—too hot kills it, too cold slows fermentation",
      "The oat bran adds fiber and a slightly nutty flavor; it also absorbs more water, so monitor dough consistency",
      "Bake until the internal temperature reaches 190°F for a fully cooked loaf"
