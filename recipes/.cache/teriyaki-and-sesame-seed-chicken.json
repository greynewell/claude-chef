    "cookingTips": [
      "Pat the chicken completely dry after washing to ensure proper caramelization and browning in the pan",
      "The three-dressing marinade creates a thick, sticky glaze — don't skip marinating for at least 20 minutes to allow flavors to penetrate the meat",
      "Cook the chicken undisturbed on each side for several minutes to develop a golden, caramelized crust rather than moving it around constantly",
      "Check doneness by slicing into the thickest piece; the meat should be completely white with no pink in the center to ensure food safety",
      "Toast sesame seeds lightly in a dry pan before garnishing for enhanced nutty flavor, or sprinkle them raw for a crunchier texture"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making Teriyaki and Sesame Seed Chicken. Please guide me through the cooking process step-by-step with timing and techniques. The recipe involves slicing chicken breasts into half-inch strips, marinating them in a mixture of teriyaki sauce, Italian dressing, and ginger salad dressing for at least 20 minutes, then pan-searing them in butter over medium-high heat until caramelized on both sides. I need help with: 1) How to slice the chicken evenly and why drying it thoroughly matters, 2) The proper marinading time and temperature, 3) How to achieve the caramelized crust without overcooking, 4) How to check for doneness accurately, and 5) Tips for finishing with sesame seeds. Please provide specific temperatures, timing for each step, and visual cues to watch for."
