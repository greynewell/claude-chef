      "The combination of oat bran, flax seed meal, and whole wheat flour creates a dense, nutritious loaf with a slightly grainy texture",
      "These whole grain additions absorb more water, so the dough may seem slightly wetter than a traditional bread dough",
      "Allow extra rising time due to the density of the whole grains; the loaf may not rise as much as white bread"
