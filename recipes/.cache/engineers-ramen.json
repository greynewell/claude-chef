    "cookingTips": [
      "Blanching and scrubbing the bones is essential—this removes impurities that would cloud your broth and create a cleaner, more refined final product.",
      "Maintain a vigorous simmer rather than a rolling boil to extract maximum collagen and flavor while keeping the broth clear. Add water gradually as it reduces to maintain liquid level.",
      "The broth should turn opaque and creamy from emulsified bone marrow and collagen, typically after 3-4 hours total simmering. Don't rush this process.",
      "Cook fresh ramen noodles al dente (firm texture) for 2-3 minutes—overcooked noodles will become mushy and absorb too much broth.",
      "Prepare chashu pork belly in advance (braised and sliced); assemble the final bowls quickly by warming broth and noodles just before serving to preserve texture and temperature."

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making Engineer's Ramen from scratch and need detailed step-by-step guidance. The recipe calls for a 4-hour broth using pork bones and chicken, with specific blanching and simmering techniques. Please provide: 1) Detailed instructions for blanching and cleaning the bones to achieve a clear broth, 2) The exact simmering temperature and signs that the broth is properly extracted (opaque, creamy appearance), 3) Timing and technique for soft-boiling eggs to achieve jammy centers, 4) How to properly cook fresh ramen noodles to achieve the right texture, 5) Assembly order for the final bowls to maximize presentation and temperature retention, 6) Troubleshooting tips if the broth isn't turning creamy enough or tastes underseasoned. Include temperature guidance where relevant and explain the science behind why each step matters for achieving an authentic ramen experience."
