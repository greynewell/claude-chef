    "cookingTips": [
      "The boiling water activates the bran and creates a dough that's easier to work with than traditional flour tortillas",
      "Let the dough rest for 10 minutes after adding boiling water before rolling to allow it to cool and firm up",
      "Cook on a very hot skillet or griddle for 1-2 minutes per side until light spots appear; they should be flexible, not crispy"

    "coachingPrompt": "Why use boiling water in this tortilla dough, and how does oat bran change the texture and flavor compared to traditional flour tortillas?"
