      "Don't overmix the batter—lumps are okay. Overmixing develops gluten and results in tough, dense pancakes rather than fluffy ones.",
      "Preheat your cast iron skillet for the full 5 minutes to ensure even browning and proper cooking on the first side.",
      "Use a 1/3 cup measure to portion batter consistently, which helps ensure even cooking across all pancakes.",
      "Watch for bubbles on the surface as your cue to flip—this indicates the bottom is set and the interior is cooking properly.",
      "Whole wheat pancakes are naturally denser than all-purpose flour pancakes, so don't expect them to be as fluffy; the texture should be hearty and substantial."

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making 100% Whole Wheat Pancakes and need detailed step-by-step guidance. Please walk me through: (1) how to properly whisk the dry ingredients together without overmixing, (2) the technique for combining wet and dry ingredients to achieve the right batter consistency, (3) how to preheat a cast iron skillet correctly for pancakes, (4) what visual cues indicate when to flip the pancake, (5) how long each side should cook and what to look for to know when it's done, and (6) tips for keeping finished pancakes warm while cooking the rest of the batch. Also explain why whole wheat pancakes might cook differently than regular pancakes and how to adjust technique accordingly."
