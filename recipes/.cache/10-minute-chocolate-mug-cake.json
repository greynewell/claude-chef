      "Use a mug that is at least 12-16 ounces to prevent overflow as the cake rises during cooking.",
      "Thoroughly mix all dry ingredients with wet ingredients to avoid lumps and ensure even cooking.",
      "Start checking the cake at 1.5 minutes, as microwave power varies; it should be done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean but slightly moist.",
      "Let the mug cool for 1-2 minutes after microwaving before eating, as the ceramic will be very hot and the cake will continue to set slightly.",
      "For a richer chocolate flavor, use Dutch-process cocoa powder or add a pinch of espresso powder to the dry ingredients."

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making a 10-minute chocolate mug cake for one serving. Please walk me through the entire process step-by-step. Start by explaining how to properly combine 5 tablespoons white sugar, ¼ cup all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt in a microwave-safe mug. Then guide me through mixing in 3 tablespoons milk, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 1 egg, and a dash of vanilla extract until I have a smooth batter with no lumps. Next, provide detailed microwave cooking instructions including initial cooking time, how to check for doneness, and what the center should look like when done. Finally, explain the resting period and how to safely serve this hot dessert. Include tips for avoiding overflow, adjusting cooking time for different microwave power levels, and variations for different chocolate intensities."
