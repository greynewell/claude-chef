    "cookingTips": [
      "Slice the sausage to 1/4-inch thickness for even cooking and better flavor distribution throughout the jambalaya",
      "If using shrimp, have it fully prepped before cooking as it cooks very quickly (3-5 minutes) and can become tough if overcooked",
      "Drain the canned tomatoes thoroughly to prevent excess liquid from making the rice mushy; use half initially and reserve the rest for later",
      "Keep the rice mix lid on during cooking to trap steam and ensure the rice cooks evenly and absorbs all the liquid",
      "Stir the sausage and protein into the cooked rice gently to maintain the rice texture and distribute heat through without breaking up the grains"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making 1-2-3 Jambalaya with Johnsonville andouille sausage. Please walk me through this recipe step-by-step with timing guidance. Key things to remember: I need to prepare the sausage and protein (shrimp or chicken) first by coating with Cajun Creole seasoning, then cook them in a skillet until done (shrimp turns pink or chicken is no longer pink). Simultaneously, I'll prepare the jambalaya rice mix in a saucepan according to package directions, adding half the drained diced tomatoes after preparation. At the 12-minute mark of rice cooking, I'll add the remaining tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce, and fresh parsley, then continue cooking covered on low heat until the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender. Finally, I'll combine the cooked protein and sausage with the rice. Please provide specific timing for each step, tips to know when the shrimp or chicken is perfectly cooked, how to tell when the rice is done, and any technique advice for combining everything without overcooking the seafood or poultry."
