      "Heat butter over medium heat until foaming before adding eggs; this prevents sticking and ensures even cooking",
      "Stir the beaten eggs frequently and gently, allowing them to form large soft curds rather than small pieces",
      "Add cottage cheese just before the eggs finish cooking so it doesn't break down and it adds creamy texture to each bite"
