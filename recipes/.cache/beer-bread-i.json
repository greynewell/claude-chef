    "cookingTips": [
      "This no-yeast bread relies on beer's carbonation for rise—don't overmix or you'll lose the bubbles",
      "Beer bread is best served warm and fresh; it has a tender crumb from the minimal mixing",
      "The beer flavor is subtle; the sugar balances it with slight sweetness"
    ],
    "coachingPrompt": "Guide the cook to understand this is a quick bread: minimal mixing yields tender crumb, and the beer provides both flavor and leavening."
