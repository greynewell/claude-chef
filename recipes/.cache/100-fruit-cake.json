      "Choose a watermelon that feels heavy for its size and has a creamy yellow spot on the bottom, indicating ripeness",
      "Chill all fruits thoroughly before assembly to keep the fruit cake cold and fresh longer",
      "Cut watermelon slices evenly (1-2 inches thick) to ensure stable, level layers for the cake structure",
      "Use a sharp knife dipped in warm water and wiped clean between cuts for neater fruit slicing and decorative shapes",
      "Assemble the fruit cake no more than 2 hours before serving to prevent excess moisture from making the layers unstable"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making a 100% Fruit 'Cake' that serves 8 people and needs to be ready in under 30 minutes. Please walk me through the process step-by-step: First, help me select and prepare a seedless watermelon, strawberries, and optional cantaloupe and pineapple. Then guide me through cutting 3 thick watermelon slices (1-2 inches) and trimming the rind properly. Next, explain how to layer these slices alternately with sliced strawberries, cantaloupe, and pineapple to create a stable, attractive tiered cake structure. Then help me cut decorative shapes from remaining fruit using cookie cutters or a knife. Finally, advise me on proper refrigeration, plating, and slicing technique to serve individual wedges. Include tips for keeping everything cold, preventing the structure from becoming too moist, and making the presentation look appealing."
