      "Stop cooking pasta 1 minute before al dente—carryover cooking in the hot pan will finish it perfectly while maintaining texture for emulsification",
      "Render guanciale in a cold pan to render fat slowly and evenly; starting with heat will cause edges to brown too quickly before fat releases",
      "Keep egg mixture off heat before combining with pasta; the residual heat from the pasta and pan is precisely calibrated to cook eggs without scrambling",
      "Add pasta water gradually and whisk constantly during combining; this creates the silky emulsified sauce rather than clumpy scrambled eggs",
      "Work quickly once combining hot pasta with eggs; the window between perfectly creamy and scrambled is only 30-60 seconds"

    "coachingPrompt": "Guide me through making authentic high-protein carbonara step-by-step. I need to understand: (1) how to properly render guanciale by starting in a cold pan and cooking for 8 minutes until edges are crisp, (2) the critical technique of whisking eggs with Pecorino and Parmesan into a thick paste before combining, (3) why the pasta must be stopped 1 minute short of al dente and how to reserve pasta water, (4) the exact timing and method for tossing hot drained pasta in the guanciale pan for 30 seconds, (5) the precise technique for adding the egg mixture and pasta water tablespoon by tablespoon while tossing vigorously to create a glossy emulsified sauce without scrambling the eggs, and (6) how to serve immediately. Include temperature guidance and explanations of why each step matters for achieving the creamy sauce texture."
