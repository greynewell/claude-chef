    "cookingTips": [
      "Cut broccoli florets uniformly so they roast evenly and achieve consistent charring on the edges within the 35-minute timeframe.",
      "Spread the butter on the hot pan before adding broccoli to create a non-stick surface and enhance browning through the Maillard reaction.",
      "Mix the teriyaki and Worcestershire sauces together before drizzling to ensure even distribution across all florets.",
      "Check the broccoli every 10-15 minutes and stir gently to prevent over-charring on one side while ensuring all pieces get crispy edges.",
      "Save broccoli stems for vegetable stock or peel and roast separately as they take longer to soften than florets."

    "coachingPrompt": "Please provide step-by-step guidance for making Teriyaki Roasted Broccoli. The recipe involves preheating an oven to 400°F, buttering a foil-lined baking sheet, cutting 1 large head of broccoli into small florets, arranging them in a single layer, drizzling with 2 tablespoons each of teriyaki sauce and Worcestershire sauce, seasoning with cracked black pepper and garlic powder, then roasting for 35 minutes while checking every 10-15 minutes until edges are lightly charred and stems are tender. Please explain the best techniques for buttering the pan, cutting uniform florets, distributing the sauces evenly, and monitoring the broccoli during roasting to achieve crispy edges without burning. Also include tips for knowing when the broccoli is perfectly done and how to troubleshoot if it's cooking too quickly or slowly."
