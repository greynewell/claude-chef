      "Use day-old rice for better texture and to prevent the cakes from becoming mushy—fresh rice contains too much moisture",
      "Don't flip too early; wait until the bottom is golden brown (about 3 minutes) for crispy edges",
      "Keep the skillet at medium heat to ensure the cakes cook through without burning the exterior",
      "For extra crispy cakes, press gently with the spatula after flipping to increase contact with the hot pan"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making 10-Minute Rice Cakes and need step-by-step guidance. The recipe combines cooked white rice, egg, basil, milk, salt, and pepper, then cooks the mixture in butter in a skillet. Please walk me through: 1) How to properly mix the ingredients so they're evenly combined, 2) The correct heat level and butter melting technique, 3) How to know when the first side is properly browned (what should I look for?), 4) The flipping technique to avoid breaking the cakes, 5) How to tell when the second side is done, and 6) Any tips for getting crispy edges and preventing a mushy center. Include timing guidance and any common mistakes to avoid."
