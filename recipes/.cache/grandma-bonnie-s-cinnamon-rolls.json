      "Water temperature should be 110°F—use a thermometer for accuracy; too hot kills yeast, too cool won't activate it",
      "Roll dough gently and evenly to ensure uniform spirals; uneven rolling causes some rolls to cook faster than others",
      "Apply icing while rolls are still warm so it melts slightly and adheres, but not so hot that it becomes runny"
