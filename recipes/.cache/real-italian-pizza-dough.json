      "Use fresh compressed yeast if available for superior flavor; store-bought active dry yeast works but differs slightly",
      "Knead dough for 10-15 minutes until smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky—properly developed dough develops gluten for chewy crust",
      "Allow dough to rise slowly at cool room temperature (68-70°F) for 2-3 hours or overnight in refrigerator for better flavor development"
    ],
    "coachingPrompt": "Explain the value of slow fermentation and cold proofing for authentic pizza flavor. Guide on dough hydration and gluten development for proper texture."
