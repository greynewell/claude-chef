    "cookingTips": [
      "Maintain water temperature at 110°F (43°C) for optimal yeast activation; use a kitchen thermometer to ensure accuracy and avoid killing the yeast with water that's too hot",
      "When kneading dough in steps 5-6, the multiple kneading sessions develop gluten structure; the dough should transition from sticky to smooth and elastic with a springy feel",
      "Allow adequate rise time by placing the dough in a warm, draft-free location; a turned-off oven with the light on or a warm corner of your kitchen works well",
      "Tap the bottom of baked loaves to test for doneness; a hollow sound indicates the bread is fully baked, while a dense thud suggests it needs more time",
      "Cool loaves on wire racks rather than in pans to prevent a soggy bottom crust from steam accumulation"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making 100 Percent Whole Wheat Bread and need step-by-step guidance. Please help me through the process with timing and technique tips. Key details: I have 1¾ cups warm water (110°F), ¼ cup honey, 2 teaspoons instant yeast, 6 cups whole wheat flour, 6 tablespoons vital wheat gluten, and various seeds (flax, sesame, sunflower, plus flax meal, oats, and quinoa). I also have 1 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil. Please provide: 1) How to properly activate the yeast and what signs to look for, 2) The best technique for mixing and kneading the dense seed-filled dough, 3) Detailed guidance on the two rise periods including optimal temperature and how to tell when dough has doubled, 4) Instructions for shaping the dough into two loaves, 5) Baking temperature and how to determine when the loaves are perfectly baked, and 6) Cooling instructions to achieve the best crust and texture. The recipe makes 12 servings at 281 calories each."
