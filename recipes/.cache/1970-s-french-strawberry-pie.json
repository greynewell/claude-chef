      "Cool the cooked strawberry mixture completely before pouring onto the pie to prevent the cream cheese layer from melting or becoming soggy",
      "Chill the assembled pie for the full 2 hours to ensure the filling sets properly and holds its shape when sliced",
      "Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form, then add sugar gradually to avoid overbeating and creating a grainy texture"

    "coachingPrompt": "I'm making a 1970's French Strawberry Pie. Please guide me through each step with timing and techniques. Start by explaining how to properly soften cream cheese and spread it in a pie crust. Then walk me through quartering and mashing fresh strawberries separately, and explain the importance of cooling the cooked strawberry filling before assembly. Include tips for achieving the right consistency when cooking the mashed strawberries with sugar and cornstarch over medium heat. Finally, provide detailed instructions on whipping heavy cream to the perfect consistency and explain why proper chilling time is essential. Include any signs that indicate each step is complete."
