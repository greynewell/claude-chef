## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon chile powder
- 2  onions, diced
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breasts, diced
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 cup basmati rice, rinsed
- 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 ½ teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon dried cilantro
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ cup frozen peas

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Mix vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons garlic, paprika, 1 tablespoon cumin, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and chile powder in a large bowl. Add onions and chicken; stir to coat.
3. Transfer chicken mixture to a casserole dish.
4. Roast in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Combine chicken broth, basmati rice, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
6. Bring a small pot of water to a boil; add frozen peas. Cook and stir until bright green, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir peas into the rice. Serve rice alongside chicken.
