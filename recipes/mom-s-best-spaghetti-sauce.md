## Ingredients

- 4 (14.5 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
- 2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- 4 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
- 3 cups water
- 4 cups fresh sliced mushrooms
- 2  onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 teaspoons white sugar
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 2 pinches baking soda
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Mix together whole tomatoes, mushrooms, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water, onions, basil, garlic, sugar, 1 pinch of baking soda, salt, and pepper in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat while stirring, then reduce heat to a simmer, and cook for at least 4 hours.
2. Stir in remaining pinch of baking soda; sauce will foam. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick and almost brown. Make sure to scrape the sides of the pan into the sauce.
3. Stir in Parmesan cheese. Taste sauce: if too tangy or acidic, add another pinch of baking soda and simmer for 30 more minutes.
4. Let sauce cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight. Reheat the next day and serve.
