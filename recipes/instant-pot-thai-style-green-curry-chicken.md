## Ingredients

- 1 (13.5 ounce) can coconut milk
- ¼ cup chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons green curry paste
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, chopped into bite-sized pieces
- 1  lime, zested
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 6 ounces snow peas
- 1  red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
- ¼ cup chopped cilantro

## Instructions

1. Mix coconut milk, chicken broth, curry paste, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, and basil in a bowl with a whisk until smooth. Set aside.
2. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Heat oil in the pot. Add chicken and saute, stirring occasionally until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Add lime zest, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno to the pot and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Press Cancel.
3. Pour coconut curry mixture into the pot and stir well with a wooden spoon, scraping to loosen any browned bits from the bottom. Close and lock the lid. Select High pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build before the cooking time begins.
4. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Select the Saute function once more. Add snow peas and bell pepper and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Press Cancel. Garnish curry with chopped cilantro.
