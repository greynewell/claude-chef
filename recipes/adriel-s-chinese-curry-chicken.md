## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon yellow curry paste
- ½ cup chicken broth, divided
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons curry powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 4 ½ teaspoons light soy sauce
- 1 (5.6 ounce) can coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 3  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 1  onion, sliced
- 2  potatoes - peeled, halved, and sliced

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mash yellow curry paste with about 2 tablespoons of chicken broth to help dissolve paste; whisk in remaining chicken broth, sugar, curry powder, salt, light soy sauce, and coconut milk. Set aside.
2. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat for about 30 seconds; add oil and heat until shimmering, about 30 more seconds. Stir chicken, garlic, and ginger into hot oil; cook and stir until chicken has begun to brown and garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in onion and potatoes; toss well and pour in sauce mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover the wok. Simmer until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
