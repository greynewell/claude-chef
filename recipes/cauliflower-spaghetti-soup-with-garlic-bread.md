## Ingredients

- 1 (8 ounce) baguette
- 3 tablespoons salted butter, softened, or more to taste
- 2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste
- 3 cups water
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon base
- 1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets
- ¾ (16 ounce) package spaghetti, broken into small pieces
- 1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
- 8 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste
- 3 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- ¼ teaspoon sea salt
- ¼ teaspoon garlic salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Prepare garlic bread: slice baguette in half lengthwise and slather in butter. Sprinkle minced garlic and garlic salt over both sides. Put halves together and wrap in aluminum foil.
3. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and slice at an angle. Set aside.
4. While the garlic bread is in the oven, combine water and bouillon for soup in a large stockpot; bring to a boil. Add cauliflower and broken spaghetti. Stir to submerge pasta and return to a boil. Cook for 8 minutes.
5. At the same time, heat a saucepan over medium-low heat for 3 minutes. Add olive oil and then garlic; simmer until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in tomato sauce to sear in the garlic and oil flavor; set aside.
6. When cauliflower and pasta have cooked for 8 minutes, pour tomato sauce into the stockpot; stir to mix. Add sea salt, garlic salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low and cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes longer.
7. Ladle soup into bowls and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve with garlic bread.
