## Ingredients

- 1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated French bread dough (such as Pillsbury®)
- ¼ cup melted butter, divided
- 1 tablespoon cornmeal
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon shredded Cheddar cheese
- 1 pinch dried parsley
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 1 pinch onion powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking sheet.
2. Roll dough out into a large rectangle on a flat work surface. Brush with 3 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip dough over and scatter mozzarella cheese, Mexican cheese blend, and 1 cup Cheddar cheese on top. Fold the dough in half and press edges together with your fingers to seal.
3. Brush remaining 1 tablespoon butter over dough and lightly sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon Cheddar cheese, dried parsley, garlic powder, and onion powder. Make shallow cuts 1 inch apart across the top with a knife, so that you can easily pull the bread apart after baking.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown and cheese is bubbly about 25 minutes. Cool 5 minutes before pulling strips apart.
