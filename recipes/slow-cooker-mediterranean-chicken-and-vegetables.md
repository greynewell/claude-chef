## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 8  bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed
- 1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 12  marinated artichoke hearts, drained
- 4 large carrots, chopped
- 4 large garlic cloves, halved
- 1 (3 inch) piece cinnamon stick
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed
- 1 large sweet onion, halved and thinly sliced
- ½ pound green beans, trimmed and halved
- 1  red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro
- 3 cups water
- 2 cups couscous

## Instructions

1. Combine turmeric, ginger, coriander, salt, cumin, and cayenne pepper in a small cup. Rub mixture over chicken and let sit at least 30 minutes.
2. Combine chickpeas, diced tomatoes, artichoke hearts, carrots, garlic, and cinnamon stick in the bottom of a 6- to 7-quart slow cooker.
3. Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the slow cooker, bone-side-up. Add onion to the same skillet. Saute over medium-high heat until onions have taken on a yellow color from turmeric and are starting to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the slow cooker.
4. Cover the slow cooker and cook on Low for approximately 2 hours.
5. Place green beans and bell pepper over chicken. Cover and cook approximately 3 hours more.
6. Meanwhile, boil 3 cups of water in a saucepan. Add couscous and stir. Cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let sit until water is absorbed and couscous is tender, 5 to 10 minutes.
7. Place hot couscous on each plate and top with chicken and vegetables. Spoon juices from the slow cooker over each serving.
