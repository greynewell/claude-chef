## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups boiling water
- 1 tablespoon saffron
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 3 cups chopped cabbage
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- 2 cups basmati rice
- 1 ½ cups cold water
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 cup hot water

## Instructions

1. Pour boiling water over ground saffron; let sit for 30 minutes. Reserve 1/4 cup for rice; save remaining brewed saffron for another use.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Sauté onion until light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and turmeric. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.
3. Heat remaining oil in another pan over medium heat. Sauté cabbage until tender, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and ginger. Stir mixture into ground beef mixture and continue to cook over low heat, covered, for 5 minutes, adding 1 tablespoon of water if the mixture is dry.
4. Rinse and drain rice; transfer to a pot. Add cold water, butter, and remaining salt. Bring mixture to a boil, uncovered. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until rice is half-cooked and water has evaporated, 10 to 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
5. Add beef mixture to the rice and slowly mix to incorporate. Turn the heat to low. Add hot water and reserved 1/4 cup brewed saffron to the rice, cover the pot, and let cook until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.
