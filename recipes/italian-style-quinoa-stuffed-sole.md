## Ingredients

- ¼ cup quinoa
- ½ cup water
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 4 (2 ounce) sole fillets
- 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 4  lemon slices
- ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- ½ cup water

## Instructions

1. Stir together the quinoa, 1/2 cup water, parsley, basil, and lemon zest in a small saucepan over high heat.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes.
3. Pour into a mixing bowl, fold in the Parmesan cheese, and allow the mixture to cool.
4. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source.
5. Lightly grease a small baking dish.
6. Spoon a quarter of the quinoa mixture onto one end of each sole fillet.
7. Fold the other side of the sole overtop, sprinkle with black pepper, and place a lemon slice on top.
8. Place the sole into the prepared baking dish, and add the vinegar and remaining water.
9. Broil in the preheated oven until the sole flakes easily with a fork, and the flesh is opaque, 3 to 4 minutes.
