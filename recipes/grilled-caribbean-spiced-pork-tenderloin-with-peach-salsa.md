## Ingredients

- ¾ cup fresh peaches, peeled and diced
- 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
- 1 tablespoon lime juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon Caribbean jerk seasoning
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary

## Instructions

1. Combine peaches, bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set peach salsa aside.
2. Combine olive oil, brown sugar, Caribbean jerk seasoning, thyme, rosemary, and seasoned salt in a second small bowl. Rub tenderloin with the spice mixture.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
