## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons plain low-fat Greek yogurt
- 1 tablespoon mustard, or to taste
- 3  cherry tomatoes, diced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste
- 2 teaspoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill, or to taste
- 1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup baby spinach, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and place in the refrigerator until cold, about 30 minutes.
