## Ingredients

- 1  English cucumber, cut into matchsticks
- ¼ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)  (Optional)
- 1 bunch fresh spinach, cut into thin strips
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2  carrots, cut into matchsticks
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pound thinly-sliced beef top round steak
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 4  large eggs
- 4 cups cooked white rice
- 4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.
2. Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce..
3. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.
4. Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.
5. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
6. Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.
