## Ingredients

- 2 pounds hot Italian sausage
- 2 pounds ground sirloin
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1  red bell pepper, chopped
- 1  yellow bell pepper, chopped
- 1  green bell pepper, chopped
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 2  jalapeno peppers, finely chopped
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2  bay leaves
- 2 cups Merlot or other dry red wine
- 2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, undrained and chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in Italian sausage and ground sirloin. Cook and stir until meat is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.
2. Transfer meat to a large Dutch oven; place over medium-high heat. Stir in chopped onion; add red, yellow, and green bell peppers, garlic, and jalapeno peppers. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
3. Mix in chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, tomato paste, oregano, salt, black pepper, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes more.
4. Stirring constantly, pour in wine, chopped tomatoes and their juice, kidney beans, tomato sauce, and chopped chipotle chiles in sauce. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour.
5. Uncover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Discard bay leaves before serving.
