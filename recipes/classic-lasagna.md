## Ingredients

- 9  lasagna noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 pound bulk Italian sausage
- 1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
- 1 teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon dried basil
- 4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 3  eggs, beaten
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
3. Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.
5. Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.
6. Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
