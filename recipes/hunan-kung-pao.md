## Ingredients

- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
- 20  peeled and deveined large shrimp (21 to 30 per pound)
- 4 teaspoons soy sauce
- 4 teaspoons rice wine
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil  (Optional)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ cup vegetable oil, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 16  dried red chile peppers, cut in half
- 2 teaspoons Szechuan peppercorns  (Optional)
- 1  red bell pepper, sliced
- 1  green bell pepper, sliced
- ¼ cup dark soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice wine
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 1 cup salted peanuts
- 4  green onions, cut into 3 inch lengths
- 2 dashes sesame oil, or to taste  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken and shrimp in a mixing bowl along with 4 teaspoons soy sauce, 4 teaspoons rice wine, and 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Sprinkle with cornstarch, and mix until evenly combined. Set aside to marinate for 25 minutes.
2. Heat 1/2 of the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat. Stir in chicken mixture and cook until chicken has turned white on the outside and is still a bit pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken mixture and wipe the wok clean.
3. Heat remaining vegetable oil over high heat. Stir in garlic; cook for a few seconds until garlic begins to turn brown. Stir in dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns; cook and stir for a few seconds until peppers begin to darken.
4. Add red and green bell peppers, dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice wine, and sugar. Bring to a boil and stir in chicken mixture. Cook until peppers are nearly tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes more. Stir in peanuts and green onion until green onion becomes limp. Stir in a few drops of sesame oil to serve.
