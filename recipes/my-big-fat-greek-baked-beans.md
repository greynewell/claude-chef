## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried Corona beans
- 3 quarts cold water
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 large red onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, sliced
- 2 cups tomato sauce
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 3 tablespoons honey
- ½ cup chopped fresh dill
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
- ¼ cup red wine vinegar
- 2 cups water, or more as needed
- 4 ounces feta cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill

## Instructions

1. Place Corona beans in a large bowl. Cover with a generous amount of water and let soak, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Drain beans into a pot. Add 3 quarts fresh water and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, stir, and reduce heat to medium. Simmer until just tender but not too soft, 45 to 60 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Drain beans and spread into a large casserole dish. Add red onion, garlic, tomato sauce, tomato paste, honey, 1/2 cup dill, olive oil, salt, pepper, cayenne, vinegar, and water. Mix until well combined. Place dish onto a lined baking sheet to catch any spills.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until top is bubbling and caramelized and beans are soft, about 1 hour. Check periodically and add more water if casserole is too dry.
6. Stir casserole and smooth the top. Garnish with feta cheese and 1 tablespoon dill.
