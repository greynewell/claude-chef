## Ingredients

- 6 (6 ounce) fillets black cod, bones removed
- ⅓ cup white miso paste
- ¼ cup dark brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds, for garnish
- 2  scallions, chopped
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Rinse fish fillets and pat dry with paper towels. Combine miso, brown sugar, mirin, and sesame oil in a bowl. Stir well until brown sugar is fully dissolved.
2. Place cod on a baking sheet and brush about 2 tablespoons miso glaze on each fish fillet. Marinate 30 minutes to 1 hour.
3. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
