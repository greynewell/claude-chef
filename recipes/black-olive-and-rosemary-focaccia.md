## Ingredients

- 1 cup warm water (100 to 110 degrees)
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope rapid rise yeast
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- ¼ cup minced fresh rosemary
- 2 ¾ cups bread flour or all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ cup pitted black olives
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 large roma (plum) tomatoes, sliced
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary
- Salt and pepper
- ½ cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese

## Instructions

1. Stir together the water, sugar, and yeast until dissolved, allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup rosemary, flour, and salt until a dough forms. Turn onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Gently knead in the black olives during the last few minutes of kneading. Place into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet, or sprinkle liberally with corn meal.
3. Deflate dough, and press into prepared baking sheet. Brush dough with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Toss sliced tomatoes, and garlic with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with 2 tablespoons minced rosemary, salt, and pepper. Arrange the tomato slices over the dough in an even layer. Sprinkle with grated cheese.
4. Bake in preheated oven until puffed and golden brown; 15 to 20 minutes. Cut into squares and serve immediately.
