- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Instructions

1. Place zucchini, shallots, poblano peppers, and carrots in a multi-cooker (such as Instant Pot®). Add cumin, salt, chili powder, oregano, and cayenne pepper; stir well to combine. Add oil. Turn on cooker and select Saute function. Cook and stir until just slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in tomatoes. Nestle chicken thighs into the mixture. Add stock and bay leaves.
