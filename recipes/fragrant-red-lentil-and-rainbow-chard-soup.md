## Ingredients

- 2 cups dry
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste
- 3 tablespoons vegetable bouillon (such as Better Than Bouillon®)
- 2  white onions, minced
- ½ bulb garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 2 (32 fluid ounce) containers vegetable broth
- 1 bunch Swiss chard

## Instructions

1. Soak lentils in a bowl with water to cover for 15 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil and bouillon in a stockpot over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and curry powder into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion is tender and browned, adding a few spoonfuls of vegetable broth if needed to prevent burning, about 10 minutes more.
3. Drain lentils and stir into onion mixture with remaining broth; bring soup to a boil. Cover stockpot, reduce heat, and simmer until lentils are soft, 30 to 45 minutes.
4. Trim chard leaves, stack together, and cut into 3/4-inch strips. Stir chard into soup and cook until softened, about 10 minutes more.
