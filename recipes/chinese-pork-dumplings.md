## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)
- 1 pound ground pork
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1  egg, beaten
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 ½ tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 50  dumpling wrappers
- 1 cup vegetable oil for frying
- 1 quart water, or more as needed

## Instructions

1. Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
2. Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
3. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.
4. Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
5. Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each batch.
6. Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.
