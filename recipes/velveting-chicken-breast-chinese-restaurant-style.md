## Ingredients

- 1  egg white
- 1 tablespoon Chinese rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, thinly sliced
- 8 cups water
- 1 tablespoon peanut oil

## Instructions

1. Whisk together egg white, vinegar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until smooth. Add chicken; mix to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
2. Bring water and oil to a boil in a pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium.
3. Pour excess marinade off chicken; cook chicken in boiling water in the pot until white on the outside but still raw in the middle, about 1 minute. Drain.
4. Store parboiled chicken in the refrigerator in a sealed container until ready to use, up to a few hours.
5. To serve, heat chicken until no longer pink and juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
