## Ingredients

- 1 pound sea scallops
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- salt to taste
- ground black pepper to taste
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup plain bread crumbs
- 1 tablespoon OLD BAY® Seasoning

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate.
2. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Rinse the scallops, and drop them into the boiling water; cook for 2 minutes. Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon, and pat dry. Place on the bottom of the prepared pie plate.
3. In a small saucepan, melt the butter, and stir in the flour. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, or until thick.
4. Squeeze the spinach dry, and spread over the scallops. Pour the cream sauce over the spinach, and top with mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs. Sprinkle Old Bay Seasoning over the bread crumbs.
5. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.
