## Ingredients

- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ¾ teaspoon dried Italian-style seasoning
- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- ¼ teaspoon onion powder
- 1 pinch ground black pepper
- 8  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips

## Instructions

1. In a large, resealable plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, wine, lemon juice, oil, Italian-style seasoning, ginger, garlic, onion powder, and ground black pepper. Place chicken in the bag. Seal, and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or overnight.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
3. Thread the chicken onto skewers, and set aside. Pour marinade into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat.
