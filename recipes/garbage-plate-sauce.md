## Ingredients

- ½ pound ground beef
- 1 ¼ cups water
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
- ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
- ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon ground thyme
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.
2. Transfer the cooked beef to a blender and blend until the meat is finely minced. Bring the minced beef, water, vinegar, paprika, black pepper, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, allspice, cloves, cumin, thyme, and cinnamon to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat; cook for at least 30 minutes, adding water as needed to keep the mixture moist and gravy-like.
