## Ingredients

- 2 pounds lean ground beef
- 1 large onion, minced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (1 ounce) packets taco seasoning mix (such as La Tiara®)
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 (11 ounce) can Mexican-style corn, drained
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
- 1 quart tomato juice
- 1 bunch cilantro, minced, or to taste
- 1 large lime, halved
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat a heavy-bottomed soup pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
2. Add onion and garlic. Cook over medium to medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add taco seasoning; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes. Stir in tomato juice and scrape any browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
3. Bring to a simmer; add cilantro and squeeze juice from lime halves into the pot. Simmer until flavors have melded, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
