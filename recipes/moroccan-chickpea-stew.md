## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- ½ teaspoon curry powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 3  potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 1 cup golden raisins
- water, or enough to cover
- 1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 bunch kale, ribs removed, chopped
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until the onions are translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, garam masala, curry powder, and salt into the onion and garlic; cook together until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the potatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and raisins to the pot. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover; bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
2. Add the chickpeas and kale to the pot; simmer until the kale wilts, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro over the stew and immediately remove the pot from the heat.
