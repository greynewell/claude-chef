## Ingredients

- 2 pounds lean ground beef
- 2  eggs
- 1 cup dry bread crumbs
- ½ cup finely chopped onion
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon seasoning salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained with juice reserved
- ⅓ cup water
- 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon seasoning salt
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1 large green bell pepper, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large, shallow baking sheet.
2. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs and onion. Sprinkle with ginger, seasoning salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce and sugar. Shape into one inch balls.
3. Place meatballs in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes; set aside.
4. To make the sauce, mix enough water with the reserved pineapple juice to make 1 cup. In a large pot over medium heat, combine the juice mixture, 1/3 cup water, vinegar, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Stir in cornstarch, ginger and seasoning salt, until smooth. Cover and cook until thickened.
5. Stir pineapple chunks, carrot, green pepper and meatballs into the sauce. Gently stir to coat the meatballs with the sauce. Simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes, or until meatballs are thoroughly cooked.
