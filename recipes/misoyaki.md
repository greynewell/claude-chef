## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups white miso
- 1 cup white sugar
- ½ cup sake
- ½ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)
- 4 (6 ounce) fillets butterfish (black cod)
- 2 ½ teaspoons chopped shallot
- 1  bay leaf
- 4  whole black peppercorns
- 7 teaspoons white wine vinegar
- 3 ½ teaspoons dry white wine
- 7 teaspoons heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
- lemon, juiced
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup white sugar

## Instructions

1. Whisk miso, 1 cup sugar, sake, and mirin together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until marinade has reduced, about 45 minutes. Transfer marinade to a shallow dish and cool completely, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place butterfish in the marinade and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Combine shallot, bay leaf, peppercorns, vinegar, and wine in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until only about 1 tablespoon liquid remain, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour cream into mixture and simmer until cream mixture has reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high and rapidly whisk butter pieces, 1 at a time, until beurre blanc is smooth and thickened. Strain beurre blanc through a mesh strainer to remove spices.
3. Stir lemon juice into beurre blanc until lemon sauce is evenly mixed; fold in parsley.
4. Combine soy sauce and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sweet soy sauce has reduced to 1 cup, 15 to 20 minutes.
5. Heat a skillet over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove butterfish from marinade, discarding unused marinade. Cook butterfish in the hot skillet until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer butterfish to a warmed plate and drizzle lemon sauce and sweet soy sauce around fish.
