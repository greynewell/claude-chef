## Ingredients

- 1 (14 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons sambal oelek
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 medium (4-1/8" long)s green onions, chopped
- 5 tablespoons cornstarch
- 3 tablespoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Place tofu onto a plate lined with several paper towels. Cover with more paper towels and another plate. Set a 3- to 5-pound weight on top and press tofu for 30 minutes. Drain and discard any accumulated liquid.
2. Place tofu cubes in a shallow bowl. Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce and sesame oil. Gently stir to coat. Let sit for 10 minutes or until tofu has absorbed most of the liquid.
3. Meanwhile, make the sauce by whisking soy sauce, maple syrup, sambal oelek, rice vinegar, garlic, sesame oil, cornstarch, and green onions together in a bowl. Set aside.
4. Drain any remaining liquid from the tofu. Place cornstarch in a gallon-sized plastic resealable bag. Drop tofu cubes in the bag, seal, and gently shake until coated with cornstarch.
5. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu for 4 minutes. Flip with tongs and cook until browned on all sides, about 4 minutes more. Transfer tofu to a plate and wipe the skillet clean.
6. Pour sauce into the skillet and cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Return tofu to the skillet and toss to combine.
