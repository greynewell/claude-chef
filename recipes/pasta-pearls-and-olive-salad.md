## Ingredients

- ½ pound acini di pepe pasta
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- ½ cup pitted Kalamata olives, quartered
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil; cook the acini di pepe in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
2. While the pasta cooks, melt the butter with the olive oil in a 10-inch heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Once the foam subsides, cook and stir the garlic and red pepper flakes in the butter mixture until the garlic is golden brown, about 2 minutes; remove from heat and stir the olives in with the garlic mixture. Transfer to bowl with the pasta and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to serve.
