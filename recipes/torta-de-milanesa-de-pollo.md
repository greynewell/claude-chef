## Ingredients

- ½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast
- 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch
- 1  egg
- ⅓ cup bread crumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 2  bolillo rolls, sliced in half lengthwise
- 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Valentina®)
- 2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil
- ½  avocado, sliced
- 3 slices tomato
- 2  lettuce leaves
- 1 tablespoon pickled carrots
- 1 tablespoon pickled jalapeno peppers

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).
2. Seal chicken breast in a resealable zip-top plastic bag. Pound flat to 1/4-inch thickness. Add cornstarch and shake to coat.
3. Whisk egg in a shallow bowl. Dredge the chicken breast through the egg; leave it in the bowl. Add bread crumbs, cilantro, chipotle, oregano, cumin, and pepper to the bag; shake well. Lift chicken from the bowl, letting any excess egg drip off. Add to the bread crumb mixture. Shake and press the seasoned bread crumbs over the chicken breast.
4. Place bolillo buns in the preheated oven until warmed through and toasted, about 12 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, mix mayonnaise and hot sauce together in a small mixing bowl.
6. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until browned, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut the chicken in half lengthwise.
7. Assemble the sandwiches. Spread the spicy mayonnaise over both sides of the rolls. Add equal amounts of avocado, tomato, lettuce, carrots, and jalapenos to 2 halves. Add chicken and the tops of the rolls. Serve with the remaining spicy mayonnaise for dipping.
