- 1 pound ground chicken
- ½ small onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- ½ (1 ounce) package dry taco seasoning mix
- 1  egg
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 4  wheat hamburger buns, toasted
- 4 slices pepperjack cheese
- 1  avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced

2. Mix ground chicken, onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide chicken mixture evenly and form into 4 soft patties.
