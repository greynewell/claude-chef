## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces
- ½ cup soy sauce
- ¾ cup distilled white vinegar
- 1 bulb garlic, peeled and crushed
- 2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh ginger root
- 2  bay leaves
- ½ tablespoon black peppercorns

## Instructions

1. Combine chicken, vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, peppercorns, garlic, and bay leaves in a Dutch oven; bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, basting chicken occasionally with the sauce.
2. Remove the lid and continue to simmer until liquid has reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
3. Transfer chicken to a serving plate. Strain liquid from the pot to remove bay leaves and other solids.
4. Serve chicken hot and drizzle with strained sauce.
