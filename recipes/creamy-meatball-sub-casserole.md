## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground beef
- ⅓ cup chopped green onion
- ¼ cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 loaf Italian bread, cut into 1-inch slices
- 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce
- 1 cup water
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
2. Mix ground beef, green onion, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese together in a bowl; form into 1-inch meatballs. Arrange meatballs in a baking sheet.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
4. Arrange bread slices in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine cream cheese, mayonnaise, Italian seasoning, and pepper in a bowl; spread over bread slices. Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese over the cream cheese mixture.
5. Combine spaghetti sauce, water, and garlic in a bowl; add meatballs. Pour spaghetti sauce mixture over bread. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella cheese over casserole.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
