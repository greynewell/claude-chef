## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon butter
- ½ cup sliced green onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 large cooked chicken breast halves, diced
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach -  thawed, drained, and squeezed dry
- ½ teaspoon chili powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
- 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 5 (10 inch) flour tortillas
- 2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic in butter until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken, spinach, chili powder, black pepper, and salt into the green onion mixture and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix ricotta cheese, sour cream, 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese into chicken mixture until thoroughly combined. Reserve remaining Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses for topping.
3. Place tortillas into a plastic bag, seal bag, and microwave on high until warm and soft, 30 to 45 seconds. Spoon about 3/4 cup of chicken filling down the center of each tortilla in a line. Roll tortillas around filling and place with seam sides down into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
4. Pour enchilada sauce over filled enchiladas and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses over the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and cheese topping is browned at the edges, about 30 minutes.
