## Ingredients

- 6 cups seafood stock
- 2 pounds swordfish steaks
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed
- ½ large white onion, diced
- 3 medium carrots, sliced
- 3 stalks celery, sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (2 ounce) can anchovies, minced
- 4 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- ½ tablespoon salt
- 2 teaspoons fresh celery leaves, chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
- 1  bay leaf
- 2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ½ cup uncooked white rice
- salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Pour stock into a large stockpot and bring to a boil. Boil swordfish until cooked through and easily flaked with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove fish from stock, reserving all liquid. Coarsely chop/tear fish.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate pot and heat to medium. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Saute for 5 minutes, then add garlic. Saute for 1 minute more. Pour in reserved stock. Add in anchovies, lemon juice and zest, parsley, 1/2 tablespoon salt, celery leaves, 1 teaspoon pepper, thyme, and bay leaf. Increase heat and bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low. Let simmer for flavors to marry, about 20 minutes.
3. Stir in potatoes and rice; let simmer until rice and potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes more, adding swordfish in during the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.
4. Ladle soup into bowls and drizzle remaining olive oil over it.
