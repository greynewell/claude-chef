## Ingredients

- 1  red chile pepper, seeded and minced  (Optional)
- 1  green chile pepper, seeded and minced  (Optional)
- 2 tablespoons cooking wine
- 2 tablespoons gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)
- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chile paste)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 5 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 2 cups water
- 1  daikon radish, halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/2-inch thick pieces
- 2  whole mackerel - gutted, cleaned, and cut into 3-inch pieces
- 2  green onions, sliced on the bias into 1/2-inch pieces

## Instructions

1. Combine red chile pepper, green chile pepper, cooking wine, gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger in a small bowl; mix well to make sauce.
2. Place water and daikon radish in a large pot. Bring to a boil; cook until radish is tender, about 5 minutes.
