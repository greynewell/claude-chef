## Ingredients

- 3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks
- ⅓ cup vegetable oil
- 1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- ⅓ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup chopped green onions
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 (2 pound) salmon fillets, skin removed

## Instructions

1. Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.
2. Stir together soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic in a shallow dish.
3. Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour refrigerated.
4. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.
5. Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.
6. Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.
