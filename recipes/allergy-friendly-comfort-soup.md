## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2  yams, peeled and cubed
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into large florets
- 1  jalapeno pepper, chopped
- 1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk
- 2 cups water
- 2 cups cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
- ¼ cup chopped fresh basil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1  bay leaf
- 1  cinnamon stick
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- ¼ cup crumbled goat cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the cubed yams in the hot oil until fork-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the cauliflower and diced jalapeno pepper to the yams; continue cooking until the cauliflower begins to soften, 10 to 15 minutes more.
2. Combine the coconut milk, water, and cannellini beans in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Stir the basil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, mustard powder, coriander, smoked paprika, ground ginger, cardamom, turmeric, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick into the bean mixture. Season the soup with salt and black pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, add the yam mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer until the cauliflower is tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Garnish with the parsley, drizzle with 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, and sprinkle with goat cheese to serve.
