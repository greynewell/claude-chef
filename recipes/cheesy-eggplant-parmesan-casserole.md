## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil for brushing, or as needed
- 2  eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- ¼ pound mushrooms, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce
- ¾ teaspoon dried basil
- ¾ teaspoon dried oregano
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Brush about 2 tablespoons olive oil onto eggplant slices; arrange in a single layer in a shallow baking dish.
3. Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender and browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove eggplant from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, mushrooms, and garlic until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, basil, and oregano; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
5. Arrange about 1/2 the eggplant slices in a 2-quart casserole dish; top with 1/2 the sauce, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 the Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Cool for about 5 minutes before serving.
