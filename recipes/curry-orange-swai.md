## Ingredients

- 2 (8 ounce) fillets swai fish
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste
- 1 cup orange juice
- 1 tablespoon sambal oelek

## Instructions

1. Lay fish in a glass dish; season both sides with black pepper and curry powder. Pour soy sauce on top, making sure to coat both sides. Marinate for at least 20 minutes.
2. Heat olive oil in a sauce pan on medium-high heat. Place fish in hot oil and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Add ginger and ginger into the open spaces of the pan; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour any remaining marinade into the pan, along with the orange juice.
4. Cook until fish flakes easily, about 10 minutes. Remove fish from the pan and set aside. Stir sambal oelek into the pan. Cook sauce until reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour over fish and serve.
