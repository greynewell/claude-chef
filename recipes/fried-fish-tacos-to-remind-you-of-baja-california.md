## Ingredients

- 1  onion, cut into thin slices
- 2 teaspoons salt, divided
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 4  limes, divided
- water to cover
- ¾ cup sour cream
- ⅓ cup mayonnaise
- 1 quart canola oil for frying
- 18  corn tortillas
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle dark beer
- 1 ¼ pounds whitefish, cut into 3x1-inch strips
- 1  egg
- ⅓ head cabbage, thinly sliced
- 1 cup pico de gallo salsa
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Place onion in resealable plastic bag with 1 teaspoon salt, basil, and oregano. Squeeze in juice from 1 1/2 limes. Add enough water to help spread marinade all over the onion slices. Seal and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.
2. Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, and the juice of 1 lime in a bowl. Mix, adding more lime juice as needed, until the white sauce is runny. Cut the remaining limes into wedges.
3. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep pot over medium heat.
4. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place tortillas in oven to keep warm.
5. Whisk flour, beer, and egg together in a medium bowl until texture resembles pancake batter. Dip 3 to 4 pieces of fish into the mixture and fry in the hot oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining fish.
6. Place fried fish over warmed tortillas, topped with the marinated onions, white sauce, lime wedges, cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro.
