## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon O Organics™ Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 (10 ounce) box plain couscous
- ¾ pound diced cooked turkey
- ½ cup diced red bell pepper
- ½ cup half-moon sliced cucumber
- ½ cup thinly sliced celery
- ¼ cup thinly sliced green onion
- ½ cup shredded carrots
- 1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, well drained
- 1 tablespoon lemon or lime juice
- ¼ cup Safeway SELECT™ Seasoned Rice Vinegar
- 2 tablespoons O Organics™ Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- ¼ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
- ¼ teaspoon finely chopped fresh garlic or garlic puree
- 1 (8.5 ounce) can sliced peaches, drained
- 1 pinch Salt
- 1 dash Hot sauce

## Instructions

1. Pour 2 cups boiling water into a 4- to 5-quart casserole, bowl, or other non-plastic container with a lid. Stir in oil and couscous. Cover tightly for 5 minutes. When grains are hydrated, fluff them with a fork, re-cover, and place in the refrigerator to cool for 30 minutes. When cooled, fluff and separate couscous grains again with a fork. (If making ahead, refrigerate, covered, for up to 2 days.)
2. Meanwhile, make dressing. In a blender or food processor, puree lemon juice, vinegar, oil, ginger, garlic, and peaches. Add salt and hot sauce to taste.
3. Gently mix turkey, red bell pepper, cucumber, celery, green onion, carrot, and pineapple into cooled couscous. Add peach dressing. Stir mixture gently but thoroughly to ensure dressing is evenly distributed. Serve immediately.
