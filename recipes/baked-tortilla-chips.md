## Ingredients

- 1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Stack tortillas in layers of 5 or 6. Cut through each stack to make 8 wedges. Arrange wedges in a single layer on rimmed baking sheets.
3. Combine lime juice and oil in a spray bottle or mister; shake until well mixed. Spray the tops of the tortilla wedges until slightly moist.
4. Combine cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over the chips.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes.
6. Remove from the oven. Flip chips, then mist and season again.
7. Return to the oven, rotating the pans and switching racks. Bake, checking often to ensure they don't burn, until chips are lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 8 more minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. Chips will crisp up more as they cool.
