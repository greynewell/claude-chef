## Instructions

1. Toast the cumin seeds in a dry skillet over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
2. Place the cumin seeds, garlic, chile pepper, salt, olive oil, orange juice, and lemon juice into the bowl of a blender; grind to a coarse paste.

4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Cook the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until browned.
7. Place into the oven, and cook until the juices run clear, about 8 minutes.
8. When the chicken is done, remove, cover with foil, and allow to rest for 3 to 5 minutes.
9. While the chicken is in the oven, whisk together the olive oil, orange juice, lime zest, honey, and soy sauce in a skillet over medium-high heat.
10. Simmer until the orange juice has reduced to 1/3 of original volume and is beginning to get thick and syrupy.
11. Once thick, remove from heat, and whisk in the butter pieces one at a time until melted; set aside.
