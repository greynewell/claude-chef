## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1  red bell pepper, diced
- 2  poblano peppers, diced
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 3 cups diced cooked turkey, or more to taste
- 1 (8 ounce) package shredded sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
- 1 (15.5 ounce) jar red enchilada sauce
- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- 1 ¼ cups cornmeal
- ¾ cup self-rising flour
- 2 tablespoons white sugar

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and a large pinch of salt. Saute until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add bell pepper and poblano peppers. Season with black pepper, cumin, and oregano. Cook and stir until peppers start to soften, about 2 minutes. Add chipotles and adobo sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat.
3. Add turkey and half the Cheddar cheese to the pepper mixture. Add enchilada sauce, remaining salt, and chicken broth. Stir mixture and pour it into a 9x12-inch baking dish; place dish over a sheet pan to catch drippings.
