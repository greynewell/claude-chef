## Ingredients

- 4  lobster tails
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup red guajillo chile sauce (such as Herdez®)
- 1  tomato, diced, divided
- 3  green onions, chopped
- ¼ cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese
- 8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
- 1 small avocado, sliced
- ½ cup shredded lettuce

## Instructions

1. Preheat a lightly oiled grill pan over medium-high heat.
2. Cut lobster tails in half lengthwise along the spine. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Grill until slightly charred and shells are bright in color, about 5 minutes. Remove lobster meat from the shells and chop coarsely.
3. Combine chile sauce, 1/2 the tomato, and green onions in a large bowl. Mix in chopped lobster meat.
