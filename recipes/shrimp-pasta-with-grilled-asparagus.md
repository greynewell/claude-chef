## Ingredients

- 6 ounces whole wheat linguine
- 1  lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
- ½ cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
- ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 12 ounces fresh asparagus
- 4 (10-inch) metal skewers
- cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until still very firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain, reserving 2/3 cup of the pasta cooking water. Keep warm.
2. While pasta cooks, remove 1 teaspoon zest and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from lemon.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Add linguine, the reserved pasta cooking water, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Cook just until pasta is tender and most of the water is absorbed, stirring frequently, about 4 minutes. Add lemon juice, chicken broth, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and butter. Cook and stir 2 minutes more.
4. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
5. Combine shrimp, remaining oil and pepper, and garlic in a medium bowl. Thread shrimp onto four 10-inch skewers, leaving 1/4 inch between pieces. Coat asparagus with cooking spray.
6. Grill shrimp skewers and asparagus (place across the grates), covered, until shrimp are opaque and asparagus is crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes, turning once.
7. Cut tips from asparagus; cut stalks into 1-inch pieces. Stir asparagus into linguine mixture; heat through. Serve topped with shrimp skewers, the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and lemon zest.
