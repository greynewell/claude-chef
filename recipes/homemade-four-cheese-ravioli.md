## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2  eggs
- 1 ½ tablespoons water
- 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup provolone cheese, shredded
- 1  egg
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce
- 2 cups heavy cream
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce
- 1  egg
- 1 tablespoon water

## Instructions

1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing egg and flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.
2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
5. Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce over medium-low heat in a separate saucepan.
6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
7. Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.
8. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.
9. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.
10. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.
11. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.
12. To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.
