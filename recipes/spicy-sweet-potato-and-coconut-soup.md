## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds orange-fleshed sweet potatoes
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1  onion, chopped
- 1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon red curry paste
- 1 (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- 3 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the sweet potatoes directly on the rack and bake until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan or soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and ginger; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the curry paste and heat for 1 minute, then whisk in the coconut milk and vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes.
3. Remove the skins from the sweet potatoes and cut into bite size chunks. Add to the soup and cook for 5 more minutes so they can soak up the flavor. Stir in lemon juice and season with salt. Ladle into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a little bit of cilantro.
