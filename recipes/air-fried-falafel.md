## Ingredients

- 1 (15.5 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1 small yellow onion, quartered
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- ⅓ cup roughly chopped parsley
- ⅓ cup chopped scallions
- ⅓ cup roughly chopped cilantro
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- olive oil cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Dry chickpeas on paper towels. Place onions and garlic in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add parsley, scallions, cilantro, cumin, salt, and red pepper flakes. Process until blended, 30 to 60 seconds, then add the chickpeas and pulse 2 to 3 times until just blended, but not pureed. Sprinkle in flour and baking powder, scrape the sides of the bowl down with a spatula, and pulse 2 to 3 times.
2. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate, covered, 2 to 3 hours.
3. Form the falafel mixture into 12 balls; if mixture is too sticky add some flour to your hands and your work surface.
4. Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Spray falafel with cooking spray.
5. Cook in the preheated air fryer until golden brown, about 14 minutes, turning halfway through.
