## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion
- 1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic
- ¼ pound smoked salmon, cut into thin strips
- 1 large tomato, diced
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 3 tablespoons vodka
- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 ½ pounds dry fettuccine pasta
- 2 tablespoons black caviar
- ⅔ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in a saucepan or wok over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add salmon and tomato and season with salt and pepper.
2. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Pour in vodka, reduce heat, and simmer, until liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in cream and simmer until liquid reduced by half again, 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
3. Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, add to sauce and toss to coat.
4. Serve sprinkled with caviar and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Garnish with chopped parsley.
