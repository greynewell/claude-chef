## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta
- 2 cups cubed cooked chicken
- 2 cups cubed fully cooked ham
- 2 cups cubed Swiss cheese
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- ¼ cup honey
- 1 ½ cups mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons chopped onion
- ½ cup olive oil
- ¼ cup white sugar
- ½ teaspoon garlic salt
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the bow tie pasta and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
2. Combine pasta, chicken, ham, Swiss cheese, and broccoli in a large bowl. Set aside. Blend honey, mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, onion, olive oil, sugar, and garlic salt in a blender. Stir in parsley. Stir dressing into the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of dressing. Chill salad and reserved dressing in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Stir in the remaining dressing and Parmesan cheese before serving.
