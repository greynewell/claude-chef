## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 3 cups coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots)
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh shiitake mushrooms
- ½ pound fresh shrimp - peeled, deveined, and chopped
- 2  green onions, chopped
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
- ¼ cup fresh bean sprouts, chopped
- 25  mini spring roll wrappers
- 2 cups peanut oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shredded cabbage and carrot mixture and cook for 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, shrimp, green onions, and soy sauce; cook for 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in hoisin sauce. Let cool for 5 minutes. Fold in bean sprouts.
2. Put 1 spring roll wrapper on a work surface with a point facing you, like a diamond. Put about 1 teaspoon of the shrimp mixture in the center of the wrapper. Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the filling. Roll up tightly to keep the spring roll firm. Fold the sides of the wrapper over the filling. Brush the top edge of the wrapper with water. Roll up tightly to the edge; seal. Put finished rolls, seam-side down, on a plate or baking sheet until ready to fry. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling.
3. Fill a large heavy-bottomed pot with 2 inches of peanut oil and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
4. Fry 1/2 of the spring rolls until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. Repeat with remaining spring rolls.
