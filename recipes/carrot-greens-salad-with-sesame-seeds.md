## Ingredients

- 4 bunches carrots with tops
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 ½ teaspoons soy sauce
- ⅛ teaspoon white sugar
- ½ cup sliced almonds

## Instructions

1. Remove greens from carrots and then remove and discard as much of the stems as possible, keeping only the leaves. Chop leaves to about 1/2 inch. Reserve carrots for another use.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; parboil greens for 2 minutes then strain and shock in ice water. Drain and squeeze dry. Place in a new bowl of cold water and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, changing water 1 to 2 times during the process to help eliminate extra bitter flavor. Drain and squeeze again.
3. Mix sesame seeds, vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sugar together in a medium bowl. Toss in carrot greens and almonds and mix well.
4. Cover greens and refrigerate to marinate at least 1 hour before serving.
