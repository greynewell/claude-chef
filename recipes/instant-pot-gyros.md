## Ingredients

- 4 pounds pork butt, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 3 tablespoons Greek seasoning (such as Cavender's®)
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons olive oil

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Place cubed pork in the pot and cook until starting to brown, about 5 minutes. Turn pot off.
