## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup diced multi-colored bell peppers
- ½ cup sliced green onions, mostly white and lighter green parts
- 6 cloves garlic, crushed, or to taste
- 1 cup diagonally cut asparagus spears (1-inch pieces)
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons diced tomatoes and green chiles (such as RO*TEL®)
- 1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce
- 2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
2. At the same time, heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Add bell peppers, green onions, and garlic; cook until almost tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Quickly stir in asparagus and Italian seasoning. Add shrimp and diced tomatoes and chiles; toss until shrimp just start to turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add Alfredo sauce and stir to avoid sticking. Cook and stir until sauce is hot and bubbling, and shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Serve sauce over fettuccine and garnish with Parmesan cheese.
