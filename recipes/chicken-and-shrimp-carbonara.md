## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 3 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
- 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta
- 8 slices smoked bacon, diced
- 1  onion, diced
- 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese
- 4  egg yolks
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup Sauvignon Blanc wine

## Instructions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken with 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to a bowl and set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same pan. Fry shrimp until red on the outside and white on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes. Place with the chicken.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.
4. Add bacon to the pan; cook until just crispy, not crunchy, about 6 minutes. Drain on 2 paper towels. Saute onion in the bacon grease until translucent, about 5 minutes.
5. While onion is sauteeing, mix cream, Parmesan cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper, and remaining Italian seasoning together in a bowl.
6. Pour wine into the pan with the onions. Increase heat and bring to a boil. Cook until wine is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the creamy egg mixture and reduce heat. Simmer until sauce begins to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken and shrimp; mix to coat. Serve on top of pasta.
