## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped green onions
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ (16 ounce) package 4 1/2-inch wonton wrappers
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. Combine ground beef, green onions, salt, garlic powder, pepper, and ginger in a bowl; mix well.
3. Place several wonton wrappers on a plate or a cutting board without overlapping. Pour some water into a small bowl next to the plate.
4. Form about 1 tablespoon beef mixture into a ball and place it on one side of each wrapper. Dip your fingertips in the water bowl and swipe some water around wonton edges. Fold wontons in half so that they form a triangle around beef mixture. Wet your fingers with additional water and pinch edges together. Place folded wontons onto plates, ensuring they don't overlap. Continue assembling remaining wontons.
5. Brush one side of wontons lightly with sesame oil. Place a single layer of wontons oil-side down into the air fryer basket. Brush tops lightly with additional sesame oil.
6. Air fry for 4 minutes, then carefully flip wontons with tongs. Continue cooking until crispy and edges are golden brown, 3 to 4 more minutes. Transfer wontons to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool while you cook the remaining wontons in batches.
