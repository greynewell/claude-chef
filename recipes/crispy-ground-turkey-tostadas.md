## Ingredients

- 1  red onion, halved and thinly sliced
- ¼ cup Mexican crema
- 2  limes
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1  chayote - peeled, halved, seeded, and diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 1  poblano pepper - seeds and white ribs removed, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
- 6 (6 inch) flour tortillas
- cooking spray
- 6 sprigs cilantro, minced, divided
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 ¼ pounds ground turkey
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons taco seasoning mix
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 cup guacamole
- ½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
2. Place red onion slices and crema in separate small bowls. Zest limes into another small bowl. Halve limes and squeeze juice into a fourth small bowl.
3. Stir 1 teaspoon lime juice into the bowl of crema. Add the remaining lime juice to the bowl with the red onions; stir in 1/4 teaspoon salt and let marinate at room temperature until pickled, at least 20 minutes.
4. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chayote and poblano pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until golden and tender, about 10 minutes.
5. Coat tortillas on both sides with cooking spray. Place tortillas on a large baking sheet.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until crisped and lightly brown, 8 to 10 minutes.
7. Stir the lime zest, 1/2 the cilantro, onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the chayote-poblano mixture. Pour mixture into a bowl.
8. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 7 minutes. Stir in 1/4 cup water, taco seasoning, and chili powder. Cook until water has evaporated, about 4 minutes.
9. Spread guacamole over each crisped tortilla; top with chayote-poblano mixture, ground turkey, pickled onions, lime crema, and remaining cilantro.
