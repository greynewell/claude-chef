## Ingredients

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- ½ teaspoon white sugar
- 6 cups shredded cabbage
- 3 cups olive oil
- 4  potatoes, sliced 1/4 inch thick
- ¼ pound thinly sliced capicola
- 4 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella cheese
- 4 (1 ounce) slices provolone cheese
- 4 (1 ounce) slices Swiss cheese
- 8 thick slices Italian bread
- 4 thin slices  onion  (Optional)
- 4 thin slices  tomato  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk together the mayonnaise, milk, white vinegar, and white sugar in a large bowl; add the cabbage and toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour.
2. Heat oil in deep-fryer or large deep pan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); add the potato slices; cook until crispy and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

4. Arrange 4 slices of Italian bread on 4 separate plates. Top each slice with a stack of capicola and melted cheese; about 1 1/2 cups of the cabbage mixture, 1 slice onion, 1 slice tomato, and about 1/4 of the fried potatoes. Top with the remaining bread slices. Cut each sandwich in half to serve.
