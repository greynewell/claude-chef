## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup diced onion
- 1 cup diced carrot
- 1 cup diced celery
- 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 ¼ cups uncooked orzo pasta
- 1 bunch Italian parsley
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery; saute until onion is translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add chicken, salt, and pepper; cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, turmeric, and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Increase heat to medium-high and pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and shred when cool enough to handle.
4. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Add orzo and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
5. Remove and discard parsley stems; roughly chop leaves. Stir parsley into the soup with shredded chicken and vinegar. Adjust seasonings and ladle into bowls.
