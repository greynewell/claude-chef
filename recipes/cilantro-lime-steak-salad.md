## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons seeded and minced jalapeno pepper  (Optional)
- 1 clove garlic
- ¾ teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- ⅓ cup lime juice
- ¼ cup packed cilantro leaves
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
- ½ teaspoon salt, or to taste
- ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 pound flat iron steak
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup corn kernels
- 1 cup chopped yellow bell pepper
- ½ cup thinly sliced red onion
- 1  plum tomato, diced
- ½  jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced  (Optional)
- 8 cups torn romaine lettuce
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1 cup tortilla chips, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Make the dressing: Pulse garlic, jalapeño, and ginger in a blender until finely chopped. Add lime juice, cilantro, honey, balsamic vinegar, and salt; pulse to blend. Turn the blender on; pour in oil in a slow, steady stream. Blend until dressing is smooth.
2. Set an oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil.
3. Make the salad: Season steak with salt and black pepper, then transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
4. Broil in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium-rare, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
5. While the steak is cooking, stir together corn, bell pepper, onion, tomato, and jalapeño in a bowl.
6. Remove steak from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice steak against the grain.
7. Divide lettuce among 4 plates. Drizzle dressing over top, then top with steak slices and corn mixture. Sprinkle with feta and serve with tortilla chips.
