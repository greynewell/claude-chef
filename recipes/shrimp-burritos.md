## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ cup chopped onion
- ¾ cup long-grain white rice
- ¾ teaspoon cumin
- ¾ teaspoon garlic salt
- 1 ½ cups chicken broth
- ½ cup canned diced tomatoes
- 1 (16 ounce) can refried beans
- ¾ teaspoon garlic salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 12 ounces frozen cooked shrimp without tails, thawed
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- ½ cup plain yogurt
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 2 teaspoons pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 6 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed
- 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- ⅓ cup salsa

## Instructions

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in rice, and season with cumin and 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt. Cook and stir until the rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed.
2. In a small saucepan, stir together the refried beans, 3/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, and black pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until heated through.
3. Place shrimp in a bowl, and stir in garlic until shrimp is coated. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray. Saute shrimp until heated through and lightly browned.
4. In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle peppers until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.
5. Place about 1/4 cup of cheese onto each warm tortilla. Then place about 1/2 cup of shrimp on the cheese. Top with 1/4 cup of beans, and 1/4 cup of rice. Spread on about a tablespoon of the chipotle sauce, and salsa to taste. Roll up, and serve.
