## Ingredients

- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, divided
- 1 (10 ounce) box couscous
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2  lemons, juiced
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 4 (4 ounce) thinly sliced skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 1 pinch sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 2 large vine-ripened tomatoes
- 1  English cucumber, chopped
- ¼  red onion, finely chopped
- ½ cup crumbled feta cheese
- ⅓ cup chopped pitted Kalamata olives
- ¼ cup chopped Italian parsley

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in couscous. Remove from heat; cover and let stand until broth is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Uncover and fluff with a fork.
2. Whisk 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, and oregano together in a bowl to make dressing.
3. Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Drizzle 1/4 cup dressing on top. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
5. Place 3 tablespoons dressing in a large bowl; stir in sugar. Add tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion; toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add feta cheese and toss again.
6. Drizzle remaining dressing over couscous and fold in olives. Divide couscous among 4 plates. Slice chicken breasts and place on top. Serve tomato salad on the side. Sprinkle parsley over each plate.
