## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- 4 ounces bulk Italian pork sausage
- ¼ cup bread crumbs
- 1 small egg
- 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 1 (24 ounce) jar tomato and basil spaghetti sauce (such as Ragu®)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 12 (3 ounce) ciabatta buns
- 3 tablespoons garlic butter, or to taste
- ⅓ cup shredded Italian cheese blend, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Mix ground beef, pork sausage, bread crumbs, egg, Cajun seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl until well combined.
2. Form mixture into twelve 2-inch meatballs.
3. Form any remaining meat mixture into meatballs or patties, and freeze for another time.
4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat.
6. Place meatballs in the hot oil and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side.
7. Transfer meatballs to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.
8. Drain all but about 1 tablespoon grease from the pan.
9. Add onion to the pan; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
10. Add spaghetti sauce, garlic powder, and seasoned salt; bring to a simmer.
11. Return meatballs to the pan and simmer until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes more.
12. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meatballs should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
13. Meanwhile, slice ciabatta buns in half and spread butter over the cut sides.
14. Place on a baking sheet.
15. Bake in the preheated oven until buns are slightly crisp, about 5 minutes.
16. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler.
17. Place 1 meatball on each bottom bun, top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of sauce, and sprinkle with shredded Italian cheese.
18. Sprinkle top buns with more Italian cheese.
19. Broil until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
