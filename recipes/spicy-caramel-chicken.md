## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger
- 4 cloves finely minced garlic
- ¾ cup light brown sugar
- ⅓ cup rice vinegar
- ⅓ cup fish sauce
- 2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- ½ cup sliced, seeded jalapeno peppers
- ½ cup sliced, seeded mild red chilies or bell peppers
- ½ cup roasted peanuts
- ½ cup chopped green onions, plus more for garnish
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- 4 cups cooked white rice

## Instructions

1. Whisk grated ginger, garlic, brown sugar, rice vinegar, fish sauce, hot sauce, and soy sauce together in a large bowl.
2. Place chicken chunks in a bowl. Pour 1/4 cup of the prepared sauce onto chicken chunks; mix until all chicken pieces are coated. Set aside 15 minutes.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over high heat. As soon as oil starts to smoke, place chicken chunks in a single layer in the pan. Cook and stir until chicken pieces start to caramelize and turn deep brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Stir in sliced jalapeno and red peppers, peanuts, and green onions. Cook and stir one minute. Pour in remainder of sauce. Simmer until heated through, 1 or 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
4. Stir in cilantro. Serve over hot cooked rice and top with chopped green onions.
