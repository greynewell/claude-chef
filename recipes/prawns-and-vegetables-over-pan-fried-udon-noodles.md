## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup water
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- ½ tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 ½ cups water, divided
- 4 stalks celery, halved lengthwise and cut into 2-inch sticks
- ½  red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
- ½  yellow bell pepper, sliced into thin strips
- 10  prawns, peeled, or more to taste
- 1 ½ tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 (7 ounce) packages fresh udon noodles

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, water, brown sugar, and ginger in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer sauce, stirring occasionally, until ready to use.
2. While sauce simmers, combine 1/2 cup water, celery, and bell peppers in another small saucepan over medium heat. Cover and cook without stirring for about 10 minutes. Drain and keep covered.
3. Combine remaining 1 cup water and udon noodles in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles and return to the saucepan over medium heat. Stir 1/3 of the sauce into the noodles; cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Move noodles to the side of the saucepan and add prawns. Cook until opaque throughout, 3 to 5 minutes.
4. Divide noodles evenly between 2 bowls. Sprinkle prawns with lemon juice while still in the saucepan and stir to coat. Divide vegetables evenly on top of the noodles; divide prawns on top of vegetables. Spoon remaining sauce on top to taste.
