## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut in bite-sized pieces
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1  onion, diced
- 2  Cubanelle peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 3  roasted red peppers, drained and chopped
- 2  hot cherry peppers, seeded and minced
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high heat. Add rigatoni pasta and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper; cook in hot oil until lightly browned on all sides and no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and keep warm.
3. Stir onion, Cubanelle peppers, and garlic into the skillet. Cook and stir until onion softens, about 4 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and hot cherry peppers; bring to a simmer. Stir in cooked chicken and heavy cream; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Stir in pasta, then garnish with Parmesan cheese.
