## Ingredients

- ½ cup dry grits
- 1 ½ cups water
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- cooking spray
- 1 ⅓ cups ricotta cheese
- ⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup grated Asiago cheese
- 2  eggs
- 2 ½ teaspoons garlic powder
- ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
- ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 8  tomatoes

## Instructions

1. In a small pot combine dry grits, 1 1/2 cups water, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer until grits are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool.
2. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.
3. Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled grits, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Asiago cheese. Stir in the garlic powder, parsley, crushed red pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well.
4. Slice the top off of each tomato. Use a spoon to hollow out the tomatoes, leaving the outer shells (approximately 1/4 inch thick) intact. Fill each with the grits mixture. Arrange stuffed tomatoes on prepared baking sheet.
5. Bake in preheated oven until light golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.
