- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup minced shallots
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1  green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1 ½ cups tomato - peeled, seeded and chopped
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- ½ teaspoon whole allspice berries
- ½ cup chicken stock
- ¼ cup brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons chile paste
- 8 ounces rotini pasta
- 1 ½ pounds medium shrimp - peeled and deveined

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, combine garlic, shallots, ginger and oil. In another small bowl, combine green pepper, tomato, curry powder, allspice, chicken stock, Grand Marnier, soy sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, and chile paste. Cover and refrigerate both until ready to use.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
