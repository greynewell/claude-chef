## Ingredients

- ½ medium English cucumber, peeled
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
- ½ (8 ounce) container plain yogurt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste
- 1 (1 pound) halibut fillet
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 5 large baking potatoes, peeled and cubed
- ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf (Italian) parsley
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Grate cucumber into a colander and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Let stand for 15 minutes. Squeeze excess liquid from the cucumber.
2. Combine squeezed cucumber, sour cream, yogurt, lemon juice, olive oil, and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate tzatziki sauce for at least 2 hours.
3. Place halibut in a lightly oiled baking dish. Pour lemon juice over top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub fillet, then let stand for 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
5. Top halibut with parsley and dill. Spread 1/2 of the tzatziki sauce in an even layer over fish.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until fish is still moist but flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes.
7. While the fish is baking, place potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with cold salted water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
8. Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Add remaining tzatziki sauce, parsley, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Smash potatoes gently until slightly mashed, but still chunky.
9. Remove halibut from the oven. Turn on the broiler.
10. Top halibut with remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan. Return to the oven and broil until Parmesan has browned slightly and formed a crust, 5 to 8 minutes.
11. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve alongside potatoes.
