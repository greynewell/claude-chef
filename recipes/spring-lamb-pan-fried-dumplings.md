## Ingredients

- 1 pound ground lamb
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions
- 2 tablespoons finely diced Fresno chile pepper
- ¼ cup green peas, or to taste
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¾ cup seasoned rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons finely sliced fresh mint, or to taste
- 1  egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon water
- 36 each wonton wrappers
- 2 tablespoons butter, or as needed

## Instructions

1. Combine lamb, garlic, green onions, chile pepper, peas, salt, pepper, cayenne, and cumin in a bowl. Mix with 2 forks, starting on the surface of the mixture, until ingredients are evenly combined. Wrap in plastic and chill for 3 hours, or up to overnight.
2. Mix rice vinegar, soy sauce, and mint together in a bowl for dipping sauce. Refrigerate until needed.
3. Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl. Brush the edges of a wonton wrapper with some of the egg wash. Drop 2 to 3 teaspoons of filling in the center. Fold over and press edges together while squeezing out any air bubbles. Continue with remaining wrappers and filling. Let rest for about 10 minutes.
4. Heat butter in a pan over medium heat. Fry batches of dumplings in the hot butter until meat is no longer pink and dumplings are golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Serve with dipping sauce.
