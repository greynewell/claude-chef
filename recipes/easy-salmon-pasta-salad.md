## Ingredients

- 1 pound salmon fillets
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 (16 ounce) package mixed pasta shapes (such as San Giorgio® Trio Italiano®)
- ½ bunch celery, diced
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup chopped walnuts
- 1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Coat salmon with olive oil and place on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Bake in preheated oven until salmon is cooked through and no longer translucent, 15 to 20 minutes.
4. While the salmon is baking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, return to a rapid boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, 11 to 13 minutes. Drain, rinse with cool water, and drain again. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
5. Remove salmon from the oven, cool, and flake with a fork. Add to the pasta along with celery, mayonnaise, and walnuts. Mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon until well combined. Season with salt and pepper and add dill. Place in the refrigerator until chilled and flavors have combined, 2 hours to overnight.
