## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil, or more if needed
- 1  onion, minced
- 1 head garlic, minced, or to taste
- 2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth
- 4  skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into cubes
- 1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (such as Embasa®), chopped, adobo sauce reserved, or to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
