## Ingredients

- 2 ½ inch piece turmeric root, peeled and sliced thinly across the grain
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric, or to taste
- 1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, sliced
- 1 large shallot, roughly chopped
- 8 cloves garlic, peeled, or more to taste
- ¼ cup light brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons ancho chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ¼ cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon tamarind paste
- ½ bunch lightly packed cilantro leaves and stems
- 1 (2 1/2 pound) pork shoulder roast
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 5 large metal skewers

## Instructions

1. Place fresh turmeric in a food processor along with powdered turmeric. Add ginger, shallot, garlic, brown sugar, ancho chili powder, coriander, chipotle, cayenne, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, tamarind paste, and cilantro. Blend into a fine paste.
2. Cut pork into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off fat as needed. Place pork in a bowl; season with salt. Pour in the marinade. Mix and massage pork with your hands until completely coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 18 hours.
3. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Thread pork through skewers so the pieces are touching but not squished together. Reserve leftover marinade.
4. Grill skewers, brushing on reserved marinade, until pork just starts to firm up but is still slightly pink in the center, about 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve immediately.
