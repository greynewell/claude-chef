## Ingredients

- 1 cup fresh basil leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup pine nuts
- ½ cup Parmesan cheese
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 4 cups mini penne pasta
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ¼ cup pine nuts
- 1 cup chopped asparagus
- ½ cup sliced zucchini
- ½ cup sliced Kalamata olives
- ½ cup diced roasted red pepper
- ½ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Make pesto: Combine basil, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic in a food processor; blend until well combined and consistency is that of fresh pesto.
2. Start pasta: Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil over the pasta and toss to coat.
3. While the pasta is cooking, heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pine nuts and toss in hot oil until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes; remove to a plate and set aside.
4. Add asparagus, zucchini, olives, red pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes to the skillet; cook and stir until hot, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir pine nuts into the vegetable mixture.
5. Add cooked pasta and about 1/4 cup of the pesto, or more to your liking, to the skillet and toss to combine.
6. Serve in bowls topped with grated Parmesan cheese.
