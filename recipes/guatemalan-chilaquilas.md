## Ingredients

- 1 large tomato, quartered
- 1  red onion, quartered
- 1 (12 ounce) package queso fresco, cut into chunks
- 12  thick corn tortillas
- 2  eggs, separated
- 5 tablespoons canola oil

## Instructions

1. Combine tomato and red onion in a food processor; blend, slowly adding queso fresco, until a paste forms.
2. Fold corn tortillas in half and fill them with the tomato and red onion paste.
3. Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until foamy. Add egg yolks one by one, mixing thoroughly until blended into the egg whites.
