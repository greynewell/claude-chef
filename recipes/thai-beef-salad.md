## Ingredients

- 2  green onions, chopped
- 1  lemon grass, cut into 1 inch pieces
- 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
- 1 cup lime juice
- ⅓ cup fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ pounds (1 inch thick) steak fillet
- 1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces
- ½  English cucumber, diced
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes

## Instructions

1. Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions, lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or fish sauce; set aside.
2. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
3. Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).
4. Transfer steak to a chopping board and slice into thin strips; add steak and its juices into the bowl with herb mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
5. Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on top. Add steak and pour all of the herb mixture on top. Scatter cherry tomatoes over salad and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
