## Ingredients

- 8  ripe plum tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 4  poblano peppers
- 4  Anaheim chile peppers
- 1  jalapeno chile pepper, or more to taste
- 1 large green bell pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- ¼  onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 teaspoons salt
- ¼ teaspoon mesquite flavored liquid smoke concentrate  (Optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat.
2. Rub tomatoes with oil and grill for 10 minutes, turn. Place poblano, Anaheim, jalapeno chiles, and the green pepper on the grill. Grill 5 to 7 minutes per side, being careful not to let them burn. The skins should blister and brown. Remove tomatoes to a separate bowl. Place the chiles and pepper in an airtight container to let them steam while they cool so they're easier to peel.
3. Peel tomatoes and drain excess liquid. Peel and seed peppers.
4. Place the tomatoes, chiles, green pepper, cilantro, vinegar, onion, garlic, and salt in the container of a food processor. Pulse 4 or 5 times. Add liquid smoke and more jalapenos if desired. Pulse until salsa is as chunky or smooth as you like.
