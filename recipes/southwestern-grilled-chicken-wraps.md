## Ingredients

- 4 medium skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
- 1 (1.25 ounce) package taco seasoning mix
- 1 (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
- 1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ head iceberg lettuce, shredded
- 1 large tomato, diced
- 5 medium green onions, finely chopped
- 1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese
- 2 tablespoons ranch dressing, or to taste
- 10 (8 inch) flour tortillas

## Instructions

1. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season chicken with taco seasoning.
2. Cook on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Allow to cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes; slice into bite-size pieces.
3. Combine corn, beans, lettuce, tomato, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and ranch dressing in a bowl; stir in chicken. Assemble wraps as desired in tortillas.
