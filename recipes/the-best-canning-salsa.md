## Ingredients

- 30  tomatoes, peeled and chopped
- 10 cups chopped onions
- 2 cups vinegar
- 2 (8 ounce) cans tomato paste
- 2  green bell peppers, chopped
- 2  red bell peppers, chopped
- 4  banana peppers, chopped
- ½ cup white sugar, or more to taste
- 10 cloves garlic, chopped
- 8 teaspoons pickling salt
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- ½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- 17  (1 pint) canning jars with lids and rings

## Instructions

1. Combine tomatoes, onions, vinegar, tomato paste, sugar, bell peppers, banana peppers, garlic, pickling salt, and black pepper in a large stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, inspect 17 pint-sized jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until salsa is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water.
3. Remove from the heat and stir in cilantro.
4. Pack salsa into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.
5. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil.
6. Use a holder to lower jars into the boiling water; leave 2 inches of space between each jar. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 35 minutes.
7. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface with several inches of space between each jar. Let rest for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Store in a cool, dark area.
