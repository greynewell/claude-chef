## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup chopped red bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped green bell pepper
- ½ cup chopped onion
- 2 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 ½ tablespoons jerk seasoning, divided
- 2 cups penne pasta
- 1 cup water
- ¾ cup whipping cream, or more as needed
- 1 teaspoon garlic base (such as Better Than Bouillon® Roasted Garlic Base)
- 1 ½ cups finely shredded Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. When hot, add butter, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and onion. Cook until softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, slice each chicken breast horizontally creating two thin fillets. Cut each fillet into diagonal strips and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons jerk seasoning. Add to Instant Pot® and cook for 5 minutes. Cancel Saute function. Mix in penne, water, whipping cream, and garlic base.
3. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
4. Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in remaining jerk seasoning and Parmesan cheese until well combined. Add more cream if you like, up to 1/4 cup.
