## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup dry sherry
- ⅓ cup oyster sauce
- 2 teaspoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon white sugar
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 ½ pounds beef sirloin steak, trimmed and cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed
- 1  thin slice fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
- 1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained
- 8 ounces snow peas

## Instructions

1. Whisk sherry, oyster sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.
2. Arrange steak slices in a shallow bowl, pour the oyster sauce mixture over the meat, stir to coat, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
3. Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ginger and garlic in hot oil until fragrant about 1 minute. Remove and discard the ginger and garlic. Stir broccoli, mushrooms, and snow peas together in the skillet; cook and stir in the hot oil until the broccoli is bright green and almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the vegetable mixture to a bowl.
4. Pour beef slices with the marinade into the skillet; cook and stir until the sauce forms a glaze on the beef and the meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Return the cooked vegetables to the wok; cook and stir until the broccoli is heated through, about 3 minutes.
