## Ingredients

- ¼ cup ground cinnamon
- ¼ cup ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons ground turmeric
- 2 tablespoons ground coriander
- 2 tablespoons ground ginger
- 2 tablespoons crushed dried mint
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped dried apricots
- ¼ cup raisins
- ¼ cup olive oil, or as needed
- 4  bone-in chicken thighs
- ½ small onion, minced
- 2 teaspoons chopped garlic
- 1 cup chicken broth
- ¼ cup honey
- ½ bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
- ¼ cup toasted sliced almonds

## Instructions

1. Make the spice mix: Mix cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, coriander, ginger, mint, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Measure out 1/2 cup spice mix and set remaining mix aside for another use.
2. Make the tagine: Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add apricots and raisins and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water.
3. Place chicken and 1/2 cup reserved spice mix into a bowl; toss until thoroughly coated.
4. Pour enough olive oil into a large skillet or Dutch oven to coat the bottom; turn heat to medium. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until golden brown and it releases easily from the skillet, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Add apricots, raisins, and reserved 1/2 cup cooking water; stir in chicken broth and honey. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until chicken is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
6. Serve chicken garnished with cilantro and almonds.
