## Ingredients

- 1 (16 ounce) package seashell pasta
- 8 slices bacon
- 1 cup creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)
- ¼ cup white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1  red onion, finely diced

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook shell pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
2. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels; crumble.
3. Whisk creamy salad dressing, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, garlic, Dijon mustard, and oregano together in a bowl to make a creamy dressing.
