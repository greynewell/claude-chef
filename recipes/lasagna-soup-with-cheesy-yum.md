## Ingredients

- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 ½ pounds bulk Italian sausage
- 3 cups chopped onion
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 2 (15 ounce) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2  bay leaves
- 1 (8 ounce) package rotini pasta
- ½ cup finely chopped fresh basil leaves
- salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 8 ounces ricotta cheese
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 pinch freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage in hot oil until slightly brown and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Stir onion in sausage; cook and stir until softened, about 6 minutes.
2. Stir garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes into onion mixture; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato paste; cook and stir until mixture has a brick-red color, 3 to 4 minutes.
3. Pour chicken stock, diced tomatoes, and bay leaves into pot; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until flavors combine, about 30 minutes. Add rotini to pot and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Stir in basil and season soup with salt and black pepper.
4. Stir ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pinch black pepper in a bowl until well-combined.
5. Place a dollop of cheese mixture in the bottom of a soup bowl. Sprinkle some mozzarella cheese over cheese mixture and ladle soup over the top. Repeat with remaining cheese mixture, mozzarella, and soup.
